The caller will say, ‘Do you know this?’ They will say: ‘Yes, this is death.’ By then all of them would have seen it. Then it will be announced again, ‘O people of Hell!’ They will stretch their necks and look carefully. The caller will say, ‘Do you know this?’ They will say, ‘Yes, this is death.’ "" And by then all of them would have seen it. Then it (that ram) will be slaughtered and the caller will say. ‘O people of Paradise! Eternity for you and no death. O people of Hell!

And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon. [See (V.40:55)].",
19,63,تِلۡكَ ٱلۡجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِي نُورِثُ مِنۡ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّٗا, 63. Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our slaves who have been Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).,

To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between those two; and your Lord is never forgetful -",

19,66,وَيَقُولُ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ أَءِذَا مَا مِتُّ لَسَوۡفَ أُخۡرَجُ حَيًّا," 66. And man (the disbeliever) says: ""When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?""",

19,73,وَإِذَا تُتۡلَىٰ عَلَيۡهِمۡ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٖ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓاْ أَيُّ ٱلۡفَرِيقَيۡنِ خَيۡرٞ مَّقَامٗا وَأَحۡسَنُ نَدِيّٗا," 73. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, those who disbelieve (the rich and strong among the pagans of Quraish who live a life of luxury) say to those who believe (the weak, poor companions of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who have a hard life): ""Which of the two groups (i.e. believers or disbelievers) is best in (point of) position and as regards station (place of council for consultation).""",
19,74,وَكَمۡ أَهۡلَكۡنَا قَبۡلَهُم مِّن قَرۡنٍ هُمۡ أَحۡسَنُ أَثَٰثٗا وَرِءۡيٗا," 74. And how many a generation (past nations) have We destroyed before them, who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance?",

19,78,أَطَّلَعَ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ عَهۡدٗا, 78. Has he known the Unseen or has he taken a covenant from the Most Gracious (Allâh)?,
19,79,كَلَّاۚ سَنَكۡتُبُ مَا يَقُولُ وَنَمُدُّ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلۡعَذَابِ مَدّٗا," 79. Nay, We shall record what he says, and We shall increase his torment (in the Hell);",
19,80,وَنَرِثُهُۥ مَا يَقُولُ وَيَأۡتِينَا فَرۡدٗا," 80. And We shall inherit from him (at his death) all that he talks of (i.e. wealth and children which We have bestowed upon him in this world), and he shall come to Us alone.",
19,81,وَٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةٗ لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمۡ عِزّٗا," 81. And they have taken (for worship) âlihah (gods) besides Allâh, that they might give them honour, power and glory (and also protect them from Allâh’s punishment).",
19,82,كَلَّاۚ سَيَكۡفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمۡ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ ضِدًّا," 82. Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them (on the Day of Resurrection).",
19,83,أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّآ أَرۡسَلۡنَا ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ عَلَى ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمۡ أَزّٗا, 83. See you not that We have sent the Shayâtîn (devils) against the disbelievers to push them to do evil.,
19,84,فَلَا تَعۡجَلۡ عَلَيۡهِمۡۖ إِنَّمَا نَعُدُّ لَهُمۡ عَدّٗا, 84. So make no haste against them; We only count out to them a (limited) number (of the days of the life of this world and delay their term so that they may increase in evil and sins).,
19,85,يَوۡمَ نَحۡشُرُ ٱلۡمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ وَفۡدٗا," 85. The Day We shall gather the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) unto the Most Gracious (Allâh), like a delegation (presented before a king for honour).",
19,86,وَنَسُوقُ ٱلۡمُجۡرِمِينَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وِرۡدٗا," 86. And We shall drive the Mujrimûn (polytheists, sinners, criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) to Hell, in a thirsty state (like a thirsty herd driven down to water).",
19,87,لَّا يَمۡلِكُونَ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةَ إِلَّا مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ عَهۡدٗا," 87. None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from the Most Gracious (Allâh).",
19,88,وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنُ وَلَدٗا," 88. And they say: ""The Most Gracious (Allâh) has begotten a son (or offspring or children) [as the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allâh, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son [‘Îsâ (Jesus) عليه السلام], and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters (angels and others.)].""",
