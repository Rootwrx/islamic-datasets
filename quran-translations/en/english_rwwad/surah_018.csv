18,1,ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِيٓ أَنزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبۡدِهِ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَلَمۡ يَجۡعَل لَّهُۥ عِوَجَاۜ,"All praise be to Allah Who has sent down upon His slave the Book, and has not allowed any crookedness therein[1],",[1] From the straight path or from the truth.
18,2,قَيِّمٗا لِّيُنذِرَ بَأۡسٗا شَدِيدٗا مِّن لَّدُنۡهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعۡمَلُونَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمۡ أَجۡرًا حَسَنٗا,"an upright Book, to warn of severe punishment from Him[2], and to give glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have a good reward,","[2] i.e., a painful punishment that awaits them in the Hereafter, and in this life such as in the battle at the hands of the believers."
18,3,مَّٰكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدٗا,wherein they will abide forever;,
18,4,وَيُنذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَدٗا,"and to warn those who say, “Allah has begotten a son[3].”","[3] Such as the Jews and Christians, and the Arab pagans who claimed that angels are Allah’s daughters."
18,5,مَّا لَهُم بِهِۦ مِنۡ عِلۡمٖ وَلَا لِأٓبَآئِهِمۡۚ كَبُرَتۡ كَلِمَةٗ تَخۡرُجُ مِنۡ أَفۡوَٰهِهِمۡۚ إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلَّا كَذِبٗا,"They have no knowledge of it, nor did their forefathers[4]. What a monstrous word that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies.",[4] Of the reality of their false claims about Him.
18,6,فَلَعَلَّكَ بَٰخِعٞ نَّفۡسَكَ عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِمۡ إِن لَّمۡ يُؤۡمِنُواْ بِهَٰذَا ٱلۡحَدِيثِ أَسَفًا,Perhaps you will grieve yourself to death [O Prophet] over them[5] if they do not believe in this message[6].,"[5] To the extent of almost wasting yourself away.  [6] i.e., the Qur’an."
18,7,إِنَّا جَعَلۡنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلۡأَرۡضِ زِينَةٗ لَّهَا لِنَبۡلُوَهُمۡ أَيُّهُمۡ أَحۡسَنُ عَمَلٗا,"We have made all that is on earth as an adornment for it, so that We may test them as to which of them is best in deeds.",
18,8,وَإِنَّا لَجَٰعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيۡهَا صَعِيدٗا جُرُزًا,And We will surely turn all that is on it into a barren land[7].,"[7] It shows the transient nature of life in this world, so one should invest in it for what comes after death."
18,9,أَمۡ حَسِبۡتَ أَنَّ أَصۡحَٰبَ ٱلۡكَهۡفِ وَٱلرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنۡ ءَايَٰتِنَا عَجَبًا,Do you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our only wondrous signs[8]?,"[8] Rather, there are many other wonders of Allah such as the creation of heavens and earth."
18,10,إِذۡ أَوَى ٱلۡفِتۡيَةُ إِلَى ٱلۡكَهۡفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحۡمَةٗ وَهَيِّئۡ لَنَا مِنۡ أَمۡرِنَا رَشَدٗا,"When the youths took refuge in the Cave, and said, “Our Lord, grant us mercy from Yourself, and show us the right way in our ordeal[9].”","[9] The youths have sought refuge in the cave for the sake of their religion, so they asked Allah to keep them firm on the straight path."
18,11,فَضَرَبۡنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاذَانِهِمۡ فِي ٱلۡكَهۡفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدٗا,Then We caused them to fall into a deep sleep in the cave for many years.,
18,12,ثُمَّ بَعَثۡنَٰهُمۡ لِنَعۡلَمَ أَيُّ ٱلۡحِزۡبَيۡنِ أَحۡصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُوٓاْ أَمَدٗا,Then We awakened them so that We may see which of the two parties would be more precise in calculating the length of their stay.,
18,13,نَّحۡنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيۡكَ نَبَأَهُم بِٱلۡحَقِّۚ إِنَّهُمۡ فِتۡيَةٌ ءَامَنُواْ بِرَبِّهِمۡ وَزِدۡنَٰهُمۡ هُدٗى,"We relate to you their story in truth. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We gave them more guidance.",
18,14,وَرَبَطۡنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمۡ إِذۡ قَامُواْ فَقَالُواْ رَبُّنَا رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ لَن نَّدۡعُوَاْ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ إِلَٰهٗاۖ لَّقَدۡ قُلۡنَآ إِذٗا شَطَطًا,"We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and proclaimed, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth. We will never call upon any god other than Him, or we would be uttering an outrageous lie[10].”","[10] i.e., too far away from the Truth."
18,15,هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ قَوۡمُنَا ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةٗۖ لَّوۡلَا يَأۡتُونَ عَلَيۡهِم بِسُلۡطَٰنِۭ بَيِّنٖۖ فَمَنۡ أَظۡلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبٗا,These people of ours have taken besides Him other gods. Why do they not bring clear proof about them? Who does greater wrong than one who fabricates lies against Allah?,
18,16,وَإِذِ ٱعۡتَزَلۡتُمُوهُمۡ وَمَا يَعۡبُدُونَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ فَأۡوُۥٓاْ إِلَى ٱلۡكَهۡفِ يَنشُرۡ لَكُمۡ رَبُّكُم مِّن رَّحۡمَتِهِۦ وَيُهَيِّئۡ لَكُم مِّنۡ أَمۡرِكُم مِّرۡفَقٗا,"When you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship other than Allah, take refuge in the cave; your Lord will extend His mercy to you and make for you an easy way out of your ordeal.”",
18,17,۞ وَتَرَى ٱلشَّمۡسَ إِذَا طَلَعَت تَّزَٰوَرُ عَن كَهۡفِهِمۡ ذَاتَ ٱلۡيَمِينِ وَإِذَا غَرَبَت تَّقۡرِضُهُمۡ ذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَهُمۡ فِي فَجۡوَةٖ مِّنۡهُۚ ذَٰلِكَ مِنۡ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِۗ مَن يَهۡدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلۡمُهۡتَدِۖ وَمَن يُضۡلِلۡ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُۥ وَلِيّٗا مُّرۡشِدٗا,"You would have seen the sun when it rose, it would incline away from their Cave to the right; and when it set, it would turn away from them to the left[11], while they were in its open space. That was one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whoever He causes to stray, you will never find for him a protecting guide.",[11] As such they would get all the air and ventilation they needed to sustain.
18,18,وَتَحۡسَبُهُمۡ أَيۡقَاظٗا وَهُمۡ رُقُودٞۚ وَنُقَلِّبُهُمۡ ذَاتَ ٱلۡيَمِينِ وَذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِۖ وَكَلۡبُهُم بَٰسِطٞ ذِرَاعَيۡهِ بِٱلۡوَصِيدِۚ لَوِ ٱطَّلَعۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ لَوَلَّيۡتَ مِنۡهُمۡ فِرَارٗا وَلَمُلِئۡتَ مِنۡهُمۡ رُعۡبٗا,"You would have thought they were awake, although they were asleep. We turned them over on their right and left sides, when their dog stretched its forelegs at the entrance. If you had seen them, you would have fled away from them, filled with horror[12].","[12] Should anyone were to see them, he would see a group of awake men with a dog standing guarding them, and would surely be filled with horror, which was a factor in preserving them, so no one would dare to draw close to them."
18,19,وَكَذَٰلِكَ بَعَثۡنَٰهُمۡ لِيَتَسَآءَلُواْ بَيۡنَهُمۡۚ قَالَ قَآئِلٞ مِّنۡهُمۡ كَمۡ لَبِثۡتُمۡۖ قَالُواْ لَبِثۡنَا يَوۡمًا أَوۡ بَعۡضَ يَوۡمٖۚ قَالُواْ رَبُّكُمۡ أَعۡلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثۡتُمۡ فَٱبۡعَثُوٓاْ أَحَدَكُم بِوَرِقِكُمۡ هَٰذِهِۦٓ إِلَى ٱلۡمَدِينَةِ فَلۡيَنظُرۡ أَيُّهَآ أَزۡكَىٰ طَعَامٗا فَلۡيَأۡتِكُم بِرِزۡقٖ مِّنۡهُ وَلۡيَتَلَطَّفۡ وَلَا يُشۡعِرَنَّ بِكُمۡ أَحَدًا,"Similarly, We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them said, “How long have you been here?” They said, “We have been here for a day or part of a day.” They said, “Your Lord knows best how long have you been here. Send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him see who has the most pure food and bring some provision from it. And be cautious and let no one know about you.",
18,20,إِنَّهُمۡ إِن يَظۡهَرُواْ عَلَيۡكُمۡ يَرۡجُمُوكُمۡ أَوۡ يُعِيدُوكُمۡ فِي مِلَّتِهِمۡ وَلَن تُفۡلِحُوٓاْ إِذًا أَبَدٗا,"For if they find out about you, they will stone you or force you back to their religion, and then you will never succeed.”",
18,21,وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَعۡثَرۡنَا عَلَيۡهِمۡ لِيَعۡلَمُوٓاْ أَنَّ وَعۡدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقّٞ وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لَا رَيۡبَ فِيهَآ إِذۡ يَتَنَٰزَعُونَ بَيۡنَهُمۡ أَمۡرَهُمۡۖ فَقَالُواْ ٱبۡنُواْ عَلَيۡهِم بُنۡيَٰنٗاۖ رَّبُّهُمۡ أَعۡلَمُ بِهِمۡۚ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ غَلَبُواْ عَلَىٰٓ أَمۡرِهِمۡ لَنَتَّخِذَنَّ عَلَيۡهِم مَّسۡجِدٗا,"This is how We made their case known so that the people might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were disputing among themselves[13] concerning their matter [of resurrection], they said, “Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their matter said, “We will surely build over them a place of worship.”","[13] i.e., the inhabitants of the city."
18,22,سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَٰثَةٞ رَّابِعُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمۡسَةٞ سَادِسُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡ رَجۡمَۢا بِٱلۡغَيۡبِۖ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبۡعَةٞ وَثَامِنُهُمۡ كَلۡبُهُمۡۚ قُل رَّبِّيٓ أَعۡلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا يَعۡلَمُهُمۡ إِلَّا قَلِيلٞۗ فَلَا تُمَارِ فِيهِمۡ إِلَّا مِرَآءٗ ظَٰهِرٗا وَلَا تَسۡتَفۡتِ فِيهِم مِّنۡهُمۡ أَحَدٗا,"Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” – merely guessing at the unseen. And others will say, “They were seven, their dog was the eighth.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number; no one knows about them except a few[14]. So do not argue about them except in a brief manner, nor ask anyone about them.”","[14] i.e., that which is the sure argument, one in the Qur’an."
18,23,وَلَا تَقُولَنَّ لِشَاْيۡءٍ إِنِّي فَاعِلٞ ذَٰلِكَ غَدًا,"And never say about anything, “I will surely do this tomorrow[15],”",[15] For you do not know whether you will be able to do it or you will be diverted from it.
18,24,إِلَّآ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُۚ وَٱذۡكُر رَّبَّكَ إِذَا نَسِيتَ وَقُلۡ عَسَىٰٓ أَن يَهۡدِيَنِ رَبِّي لِأَقۡرَبَ مِنۡ هَٰذَا رَشَدٗا,"without adding, “if Allah wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “My Lord will hopefully guide me to something closer to what is right[16].”","[16] As soon as one remembers not saying inshā’ Allah concerning doing something in the future, he should say it. Also when one forgets something, he should mention Allah so as to remember things."
18,25,وَلَبِثُواْ فِي كَهۡفِهِمۡ ثَلَٰثَ مِاْئَةٖ سِنِينَ وَٱزۡدَادُواْ تِسۡعٗا,"They remained in their cave for three hundred years, plus nine[17].","[17] i.e., 309 years."
18,26,قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعۡلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثُواْۖ لَهُۥ غَيۡبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ أَبۡصِرۡ بِهِۦ وَأَسۡمِعۡۚ مَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِۦ مِن وَلِيّٖ وَلَا يُشۡرِكُ فِي حُكۡمِهِۦٓ أَحَدٗا,"Say, “Allah knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs [the knowledge of] the unseen of the heavens and earth. How well He sees and how well He hears[18]! They have no protector besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”","[18] i.e., Nothing can escape Allah’s Sight and Hearing."
18,27,وَٱتۡلُ مَآ أُوحِيَ إِلَيۡكَ مِن كِتَابِ رَبِّكَۖ لَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مُلۡتَحَدٗا,"Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him[19].","[19] There is no escape from the punishment of Allah, should the Message not be conveyed, recited, and followed accordingly."
18,28,وَٱصۡبِرۡ نَفۡسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدۡعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلۡغَدَوٰةِ وَٱلۡعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجۡهَهُۥۖ وَلَا تَعۡدُ عَيۡنَاكَ عَنۡهُمۡ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۖ وَلَا تُطِعۡ مَنۡ أَغۡفَلۡنَا قَلۡبَهُۥ عَن ذِكۡرِنَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ وَكَانَ أَمۡرُهُۥ فُرُطٗا,"Be patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the adornments of the life of this world. And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows his desires and whose affairs [deeds] are at loss.",
18,29,وَقُلِ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمۡۖ فَمَن شَآءَ فَلۡيُؤۡمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلۡيَكۡفُرۡۚ إِنَّآ أَعۡتَدۡنَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ نَارًا أَحَاطَ بِهِمۡ سُرَادِقُهَاۚ وَإِن يَسۡتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٖ كَٱلۡمُهۡلِ يَشۡوِي ٱلۡوُجُوهَۚ بِئۡسَ ٱلشَّرَابُ وَسَآءَتۡ مُرۡتَفَقًا,"Say, “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills may believe, and whoever wills may disbelieve.” We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire which will encompass them like the walls. If they cry for relief, they will be relieved with water like boiling oil that will scald the faces. What a terrible drink, and what a terrible resting place!",
18,30,إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ إِنَّا لَا نُضِيعُ أَجۡرَ مَنۡ أَحۡسَنَ عَمَلًا,"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will not let the reward of those who do good deeds to go to waste.",
18,31,أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمۡ جَنَّٰتُ عَدۡنٖ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهِمُ ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ يُحَلَّوۡنَ فِيهَا مِنۡ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٖ وَيَلۡبَسُونَ ثِيَابًا خُضۡرٗا مِّن سُندُسٖ وَإِسۡتَبۡرَقٖ مُّتَّكِـِٔينَ فِيهَا عَلَى ٱلۡأَرَآئِكِۚ نِعۡمَ ٱلثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتۡ مُرۡتَفَقٗا,"It is they who will have Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with golden bracelets and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining on adorned couches. What an excellent reward, and what a pleasant resting place!",
18,32,۞ وَٱضۡرِبۡ لَهُم مَّثَلٗا رَّجُلَيۡنِ جَعَلۡنَا لِأَحَدِهِمَا جَنَّتَيۡنِ مِنۡ أَعۡنَٰبٖ وَحَفَفۡنَٰهُمَا بِنَخۡلٖ وَجَعَلۡنَا بَيۡنَهُمَا زَرۡعٗا,"Give them an example of two men[20]: to one of them We gave two gardens of grapevines and surrounded them with palm trees, and placed between them crops[21].","[20] i.e., one was a believer and the second a disbeliever; the disbeliever owned two gardens.  [21] The arrogant and wealthy disbelievers of Makkah looked down upon the poor believers and demanded that the Prophet (ﷺ) expel them should he want them to sit and listen to him."
18,33,كِلۡتَا ٱلۡجَنَّتَيۡنِ ءَاتَتۡ أُكُلَهَا وَلَمۡ تَظۡلِم مِّنۡهُ شَيۡـٔٗاۚ وَفَجَّرۡنَا خِلَٰلَهُمَا نَهَرٗا,"Each garden yielded its produce and did not fall short in the least, and We caused a stream to flow through them.",
18,34,وَكَانَ لَهُۥ ثَمَرٞ فَقَالَ لِصَٰحِبِهِۦ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُۥٓ أَنَا۠ أَكۡثَرُ مِنكَ مَالٗا وَأَعَزُّ نَفَرٗا,"And he had abundant fruit. He said to his companion, as he was conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and superior in followers.”",
18,35,وَدَخَلَ جَنَّتَهُۥ وَهُوَ ظَالِمٞ لِّنَفۡسِهِۦ قَالَ مَآ أَظُنُّ أَن تَبِيدَ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أَبَدٗا,"He entered his garden, having wronged himself[22], and said, “I do not think that this will ever perish,",[22] By being proud and disbeliever.
18,36,وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَآئِمَةٗ وَلَئِن رُّدِدتُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّي لَأَجِدَنَّ خَيۡرٗا مِّنۡهَا مُنقَلَبٗا,"nor do I think that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better than this[23].”","[23] He thought should there be a tiny possibility of resurrection, based on his wrongful calculation that he was honored in this life because Allah loved him. Hence he fell into the fallacy that if he ever return to Him, he should only expect greater honoring, or he might have said that deridingly."
18,37,قَالَ لَهُۥ صَاحِبُهُۥ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُۥٓ أَكَفَرۡتَ بِٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكَ مِن تُرَابٖ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطۡفَةٖ ثُمَّ سَوَّىٰكَ رَجُلٗا,"His companion said, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in He Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned you into a well-proportioned man[24]?",[24] The One Who created such a magnificent creation in the first place is able to recreate the creatures.
18,38,لَّٰكِنَّا۠ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّي وَلَآ أُشۡرِكُ بِرَبِّيٓ أَحَدٗا,"As for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.",
18,39,وَلَوۡلَآ إِذۡ دَخَلۡتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلۡتَ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِٱللَّهِۚ إِن تَرَنِ أَنَا۠ أَقَلَّ مِنكَ مَالٗا وَوَلَدٗا,"If only you had said, when you entered your garden, ‘This is by Allah’s Will; there is no power except with Allah.’ Even though you see me as inferior to you in wealth and children,",
18,40,فَعَسَىٰ رَبِّيٓ أَن يُؤۡتِيَنِ خَيۡرٗا مِّن جَنَّتِكَ وَيُرۡسِلَ عَلَيۡهَا حُسۡبَانٗا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتُصۡبِحَ صَعِيدٗا زَلَقًا,"it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and send upon your garden a thunderbolt from the heaven, turning it into a barren land.",
18,41,أَوۡ يُصۡبِحَ مَآؤُهَا غَوۡرٗا فَلَن تَسۡتَطِيعَ لَهُۥ طَلَبٗا,"Or its water may sink, so you will never be able to get it back.”",
18,42,وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِۦ فَأَصۡبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيۡهِ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنفَقَ فِيهَا وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا وَيَقُولُ يَٰلَيۡتَنِي لَمۡ أُشۡرِكۡ بِرَبِّيٓ أَحَدٗا,"Eventually, all his produce was destroyed and he started wringing his hands [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, as it had collapsed on its trellises, and he said, “Oh, would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!”",
18,43,وَلَمۡ تَكُن لَّهُۥ فِئَةٞ يَنصُرُونَهُۥ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مُنتَصِرًا,"He had none to support him against Allah, nor could he support himself.",
18,44,هُنَالِكَ ٱلۡوَلَٰيَةُ لِلَّهِ ٱلۡحَقِّۚ هُوَ خَيۡرٞ ثَوَابٗا وَخَيۡرٌ عُقۡبٗا,"In that situation[25], the authority only rests with Allah, the True God. He is best in reward and best in outcome.","[25] i.e., on the Day of Judgment."
18,45,وَٱضۡرِبۡ لَهُم مَّثَلَ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنزَلۡنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَٱخۡتَلَطَ بِهِۦ نَبَاتُ ٱلۡأَرۡضِ فَأَصۡبَحَ هَشِيمٗا تَذۡرُوهُ ٱلرِّيَٰحُۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ مُّقۡتَدِرًا,"Give them the example of the life of this world: it is like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky, but soon they turn into chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has full power over all things.",
18,46,ٱلۡمَالُ وَٱلۡبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۖ وَٱلۡبَٰقِيَٰتُ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ خَيۡرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابٗا وَخَيۡرٌ أَمَلٗا,"Wealth and children are the adornments of the life of this world, but the lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward and better in hope.",

Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors instead of Me[28], even though they are your enemies[29]? What a terrible exchange for the wrongdoers!",[28] Demons could possess their idols and communicate through them; they also used to seek refuge from the evil of the jinn by appraising them and slaughtering sacrifices for them.  [29] Satan along with his fellow demons continues to lead people astray from the right Path.
