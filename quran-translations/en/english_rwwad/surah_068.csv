68,4,وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٖ,"Indeed, you are of a great moral character.",
68,5,فَسَتُبۡصِرُ وَيُبۡصِرُونَ,"Soon you will see and they will see,",
68,6,بِأَييِّكُمُ ٱلۡمَفۡتُونُ,which of you is afflicted with madness.,
68,7,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦ وَهُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِٱلۡمُهۡتَدِينَ,"Indeed, your Lord alone knows best who has strayed from His way and those who are rightly guided.",

68,16,سَنَسِمُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلۡخُرۡطُومِ,We will soon brand him on the snout[3].,"[3] Lit., ""trunk,"" meaning the nose of an elephant or pig. These verses refer to Al-Walīd ibn al-Mughīrah, a leader of the pagans of Makkah and a staunch enemy of Islam. He called the Prophet (ﷺ) a madman, so the Qur’an responded by mentioning ten of Al-Walīd’s qualities. (See 53:33-35 and 74:11-26). Two of those qualities were not known to him: the fact that he was an illegitimate child and that his nose would be chopped off years later at the Battle of Badr. Khālid ibn al-Walīd and two of his brothers embraced Islam."
68,17,إِنَّا بَلَوۡنَٰهُمۡ كَمَا بَلَوۡنَآ أَصۡحَٰبَ ٱلۡجَنَّةِ إِذۡ أَقۡسَمُواْ لَيَصۡرِمُنَّهَا مُصۡبِحِينَ,"Indeed, We have tested them [i.e., the Makkans] as We tested the people of the garden when they swore to harvest its fruits in the early morning,",

68,20,فَأَصۡبَحَتۡ كَٱلصَّرِيمِ,and it turned to ashes [as black as night].,
68,21,فَتَنَادَوۡاْ مُصۡبِحِينَ,Then in the early morning they called out to one another:,
68,22,أَنِ ٱغۡدُواْ عَلَىٰ حَرۡثِكُمۡ إِن كُنتُمۡ صَٰرِمِينَ,“Go early to your garden if you really wish to harvest.”,
68,23,فَٱنطَلَقُواْ وَهُمۡ يَتَخَٰفَتُونَ,"So they set out, whispering to one another,",
68,24,أَن لَّا يَدۡخُلَنَّهَا ٱلۡيَوۡمَ عَلَيۡكُم مِّسۡكِينٞ,“Not a single poor person should enter your garden today.”,

68,29,قَالُواْ سُبۡحَٰنَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"They said, “Glory be to our Lord! We were truly wrongdoers.”",
68,30,فَأَقۡبَلَ بَعۡضُهُمۡ عَلَىٰ بَعۡضٖ يَتَلَٰوَمُونَ,"Then they turned to one another, throwing blame.",
68,31,قَالُواْ يَٰوَيۡلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا طَٰغِينَ,"They said, “Woe to us! We were surely transgressors.",
68,32,عَسَىٰ رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبۡدِلَنَا خَيۡرٗا مِّنۡهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا رَٰغِبُونَ,Our Lord may give us something better than this. We certainly turn to our Lord in hope[7].”,[7] Of His forgiveness and bounty.

68,34,إِنَّ لِلۡمُتَّقِينَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمۡ جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"Indeed, the righteous will have gardens of bliss with their Lord.",
68,35,أَفَنَجۡعَلُ ٱلۡمُسۡلِمِينَ كَٱلۡمُجۡرِمِينَ,Should We then treat Muslims like the wicked?,
68,36,مَا لَكُمۡ كَيۡفَ تَحۡكُمُونَ,What is the matter with you that you make such a judgment?,
68,37,أَمۡ لَكُمۡ كِتَٰبٞ فِيهِ تَدۡرُسُونَ,Or do you have a scripture in which you read,
68,38,إِنَّ لَكُمۡ فِيهِ لَمَا تَخَيَّرُونَ,that you will be given whatever you choose?,

According to a long and authentic Hadīth of Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudrī, ""the Shin"" refers to that of Allah Almighty, before which every believer will prostrate on the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers and hypocrites will not be able to prostrate. The text of the Hadith is as follows: ""... Then the Lord will uncover His Shank, so they will prostrate to Him...""."
68,43,خَٰشِعَةً أَبۡصَٰرُهُمۡ تَرۡهَقُهُمۡ ذِلَّةٞۖ وَقَدۡ كَانُواْ يُدۡعَوۡنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ وَهُمۡ سَٰلِمُونَ,"Their eyes will be downcast, overwhelmed with humiliation, for they were invited to prostrate when they were capable[10] [but they refused].",[10] During the life of this world.
68,44,فَذَرۡنِي وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَٰذَا ٱلۡحَدِيثِۖ سَنَسۡتَدۡرِجُهُم مِّنۡ حَيۡثُ لَا يَعۡلَمُونَ,So leave to Me those who reject this message [O Prophet]. We will gradually lead them to their ruin in ways that they do not perceive[11].,"[11] Allah will increase favors upon them in this life as a trial, so they will increase sin, which will lead to their destruction."
68,45,وَأُمۡلِي لَهُمۡۚ إِنَّ كَيۡدِي مَتِينٌ,"I will give them respite, but My plan is firm.",
68,46,أَمۡ تَسۡـَٔلُهُمۡ أَجۡرٗا فَهُم مِّن مَّغۡرَمٖ مُّثۡقَلُونَ,"Or are you asking them for a reward, so they find it too burdensome?",
68,47,أَمۡ عِندَهُمُ ٱلۡغَيۡبُ فَهُمۡ يَكۡتُبُونَ,"Or do they have knowledge of the unseen, so they write it down?",
68,48,فَٱصۡبِرۡ لِحُكۡمِ رَبِّكَ وَلَا تَكُن كَصَاحِبِ ٱلۡحُوتِ إِذۡ نَادَىٰ وَهُوَ مَكۡظُومٞ,"So be patient with the decree of your Lord, and do not be like the man of the Whale [i.e., Jonah], when he cried out in anguish[12].",[12] While inside the belly of the whale. See 21:87 and 37:139-148.
68,49,لَّوۡلَآ أَن تَدَٰرَكَهُۥ نِعۡمَةٞ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ لَنُبِذَ بِٱلۡعَرَآءِ وَهُوَ مَذۡمُومٞ,"Had it not been for the grace that he received from his Lord, he would have surely been thrown onto the barren shore, blameworthy[13].","[13] Instead, Allah accepted his repentance and provided for him means of recovery. See 37:139-148."
68,50,فَٱجۡتَبَٰهُ رَبُّهُۥ فَجَعَلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ,But his Lord chose him and made him one of the righteous.,
68,51,وَإِن يَكَادُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَيُزۡلِقُونَكَ بِأَبۡصَٰرِهِمۡ لَمَّا سَمِعُواْ ٱلذِّكۡرَ وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُۥ لَمَجۡنُونٞ,"The disbelievers would almost strike you down with their malicious gazes when they hear the Reminder, and they say, “He is certainly mad.”",
68,52,وَمَا هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكۡرٞ لِّلۡعَٰلَمِينَ,But it is nothing other than a reminder to the whole world.,
