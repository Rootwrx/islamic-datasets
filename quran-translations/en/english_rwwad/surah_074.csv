This is but a reminder to mankind.","[8] To say what they want to say, so their punishment will be multiplied for them. Abu Jahl, one of the chief pagans in Makkah, made fun of the Prophet (ﷺ) when they came to know that the keepers of Hell are nineteen angels, so he ridiculed this number and said that it is an easy number to overcome."

74,45,وَكُنَّا نَخُوضُ مَعَ ٱلۡخَآئِضِينَ,"and we indulged in falsehood along with those who indulged in it,",
74,46,وَكُنَّا نُكَذِّبُ بِيَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ,"and we denied the Day of Judgment,",
74,47,حَتَّىٰٓ أَتَىٰنَا ٱلۡيَقِينُ,until the certainty [of death] came to us.”,
74,48,فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمۡ شَفَٰعَةُ ٱلشَّٰفِعِينَ,So the intercession of intercessors will not benefit them.,
74,49,فَمَا لَهُمۡ عَنِ ٱلتَّذۡكِرَةِ مُعۡرِضِينَ,"Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from the Reminder,",
74,50,كَأَنَّهُمۡ حُمُرٞ مُّسۡتَنفِرَةٞ,"as if they were terrified wild asses,",
74,51,فَرَّتۡ مِن قَسۡوَرَةِۭ,fleeing from a lion?,
74,52,بَلۡ يُرِيدُ كُلُّ ٱمۡرِيٕٖ مِّنۡهُمۡ أَن يُؤۡتَىٰ صُحُفٗا مُّنَشَّرَةٗ,"In fact, each one of them desires that open [divine] letters be sent to each of them[11].","[11] Instead of Muhammad (ﷺ), not due to the lack of proofs or signs presented to them but out of obstinacy and arrogance."

74,54,كَلَّآ إِنَّهُۥ تَذۡكِرَةٞ,No indeed! This [Qur’an] is a reminder.,
