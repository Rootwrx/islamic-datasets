21,1,ٱقۡتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَابُهُمۡ وَهُمۡ فِي غَفۡلَةٖ مُّعۡرِضُونَ,"The reckoning of the people has drawn near, yet they are turning away heedlessly.",
21,2,مَا يَأۡتِيهِم مِّن ذِكۡرٖ مِّن رَّبِّهِم مُّحۡدَثٍ إِلَّا ٱسۡتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمۡ يَلۡعَبُونَ,"Whenever new revelation comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it in jest,",
21,3,لَاهِيَةٗ قُلُوبُهُمۡۗ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّجۡوَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ هَلۡ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا بَشَرٞ مِّثۡلُكُمۡۖ أَفَتَأۡتُونَ ٱلسِّحۡرَ وَأَنتُمۡ تُبۡصِرُونَ,"with their hearts heedless. The wrongdoers whisper to one another in secret, “Is this but a human being just like yourselves? Will you then follow his magic, although you openly see?”",
21,4,قَالَ رَبِّي يَعۡلَمُ ٱلۡقَوۡلَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلۡعَلِيمُ,"He said, “My Lord knows every word spoken in the heavens and earth, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”",
21,5,بَلۡ قَالُوٓاْ أَضۡغَٰثُ أَحۡلَٰمِۭ بَلِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰهُ بَلۡ هُوَ شَاعِرٞ فَلۡيَأۡتِنَا بِـَٔايَةٖ كَمَآ أُرۡسِلَ ٱلۡأَوَّلُونَ,"Yet they say, “This [Qur’an] is a set of jumbled dreams! Rather, he has fabricated it! Rather, he is a poet! So let him bring us a sign just as the earlier messengers were sent with[1].”","[1] Such as the staff of Moses (عليه السلام), the camel of Salih (عليه السلام) and the like."
21,6,مَآ ءَامَنَتۡ قَبۡلَهُم مِّن قَرۡيَةٍ أَهۡلَكۡنَٰهَآۖ أَفَهُمۡ يُؤۡمِنُونَ,Not a single town We destroyed before them had believed[2]. Will they then believe?,[2] Although they witnessed signs and miracles.
21,7,وَمَآ أَرۡسَلۡنَا قَبۡلَكَ إِلَّا رِجَالٗا نُّوحِيٓ إِلَيۡهِمۡۖ فَسۡـَٔلُوٓاْ أَهۡلَ ٱلذِّكۡرِ إِن كُنتُمۡ لَا تَعۡلَمُونَ,"We did not send before you [O Prophet] except men to whom We gave a revelation, so [O people] ask the People of the Scriptures if you do not know.",
21,8,وَمَا جَعَلۡنَٰهُمۡ جَسَدٗا لَّا يَأۡكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَمَا كَانُواْ خَٰلِدِينَ,"We did not give them bodies that needed no food[3], nor were they immortal.",[3] Such as the angels.
21,9,ثُمَّ صَدَقۡنَٰهُمُ ٱلۡوَعۡدَ فَأَنجَيۡنَٰهُمۡ وَمَن نَّشَآءُ وَأَهۡلَكۡنَا ٱلۡمُسۡرِفِينَ,"Then We fulfilled Our promise to them: We saved them[4] and those whom We willed, and destroyed those who transgressed all bounds.",[4] After they conveyed the message.
21,10,لَقَدۡ أَنزَلۡنَآ إِلَيۡكُمۡ كِتَٰبٗا فِيهِ ذِكۡرُكُمۡۚ أَفَلَا تَعۡقِلُونَ,We have sent down to you [O people] a Book in which there is honor for you[5]. Do you not then understand?,"[5] As you have been mentioned and addressed in the Qur’an, or there is a reminder for you in it."
21,11,وَكَمۡ قَصَمۡنَا مِن قَرۡيَةٖ كَانَتۡ ظَالِمَةٗ وَأَنشَأۡنَا بَعۡدَهَا قَوۡمًا ءَاخَرِينَ,"[Imagine] how many towns of wrongdoers We have destroyed[6], and raised after them another people!","[6] i.e., who were persisting in wrongdoing."
21,12,فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأۡسَنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنۡهَا يَرۡكُضُونَ,"When they sensed Our punishment, they started running away from it.",
21,13,لَا تَرۡكُضُواْ وَٱرۡجِعُوٓاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أُتۡرِفۡتُمۡ فِيهِ وَمَسَٰكِنِكُمۡ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تُسۡـَٔلُونَ,"“Do not run away, but return to your luxuries and dwellings[7], perhaps you will be questioned.”",[7] This is said to them in sarcasm and ridicule.
21,14,قَالُواْ يَٰوَيۡلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"They said, “Woe to us! We were indeed wrongdoers.”",
21,15,فَمَا زَالَت تِّلۡكَ دَعۡوَىٰهُمۡ حَتَّىٰ جَعَلۡنَٰهُمۡ حَصِيدًا خَٰمِدِينَ,"They kept crying this out loud until We mowed them down, lifeless[8].","[8] i.e., extinguished like ashes."
21,16,وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَمَا بَيۡنَهُمَا لَٰعِبِينَ,We did not create the heavens and earth and all that is between them for fun.,
21,17,لَوۡ أَرَدۡنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهۡوٗا لَّٱتَّخَذۡنَٰهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَٰعِلِينَ,"If We had wished for a pastime[9], We could have had it from Our own, if We were to do so.",[9] Such as a wife or a child.
21,18,بَلۡ نَقۡذِفُ بِٱلۡحَقِّ عَلَى ٱلۡبَٰطِلِ فَيَدۡمَغُهُۥ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٞۚ وَلَكُمُ ٱلۡوَيۡلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ,"Rather, We hurl the truth at falsehood, and it crushes it[10], so it vanishes. Woe to you for what you falsely ascribe [to Allah][11]!","[10] Lit. ""strikes its brain,"" disabling or killing it.  [11] Claiming that He has a son, a wife, or a partner."
21,19,وَلَهُۥ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۚ وَمَنۡ عِندَهُۥ لَا يَسۡتَكۡبِرُونَ عَنۡ عِبَادَتِهِۦ وَلَا يَسۡتَحۡسِرُونَ,"To Him belongs all those who are in the heavens and earth. Those [angels] who are with Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they ever grow weary.",
21,20,يُسَبِّحُونَ ٱلَّيۡلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لَا يَفۡتُرُونَ,They glorify Him day and night tirelessly.,
21,21,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوٓاْ ءَالِهَةٗ مِّنَ ٱلۡأَرۡضِ هُمۡ يُنشِرُونَ,Or have they taken gods from the earth who [cannot even] resurrect the dead?,
21,22,لَوۡ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ ءَالِهَةٌ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَاۚ فَسُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَرۡشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"If there had been gods besides Allah in the heavens and earth, both realms would have fallen in disorder. Glory be to Allah – Lord of the Throne – far above what they ascribe [to Him].",
21,23,لَا يُسۡـَٔلُ عَمَّا يَفۡعَلُ وَهُمۡ يُسۡـَٔلُونَ,"He cannot be questioned for what He does, but they will be questioned.",
21,24,أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ ءَالِهَةٗۖ قُلۡ هَاتُواْ بُرۡهَٰنَكُمۡۖ هَٰذَا ذِكۡرُ مَن مَّعِيَ وَذِكۡرُ مَن قَبۡلِيۚ بَلۡ أَكۡثَرُهُمۡ لَا يَعۡلَمُونَ ٱلۡحَقَّۖ فَهُم مُّعۡرِضُونَ,"Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, “Bring your proof. Here is the Book of those who are with me, and the Book of those who came before me[12].” Yet most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away.","[12] The Prophet (ﷺ) is addressed to challenge the pagans to produce their proof for the existence of other gods; whereas, the Qur’an, the Torah, and the Gospel are in agreement that there is no god but Allah alone."
21,25,وَمَآ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مِن قَبۡلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِيٓ إِلَيۡهِ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّآ أَنَا۠ فَٱعۡبُدُونِ,"“We never sent before you [O Prophet] any messenger without revealing to him that none has the right to be worshiped except Me, so worship Me.”",
21,26,وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنُ وَلَدٗاۗ سُبۡحَٰنَهُۥۚ بَلۡ عِبَادٞ مُّكۡرَمُونَ,"They say, “The Most Compassionate has begotten offspring!”[13] Glory be to Him! In fact, those [angels] are His honored slaves.",[13] The pagans claimed that angels are the daughters of Allah.
21,27,لَا يَسۡبِقُونَهُۥ بِٱلۡقَوۡلِ وَهُم بِأَمۡرِهِۦ يَعۡمَلُونَ,"They do not speak before He speaks, and they only do as He commands.",
21,28,يَعۡلَمُ مَا بَيۡنَ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَمَا خَلۡفَهُمۡ وَلَا يَشۡفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ٱرۡتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنۡ خَشۡيَتِهِۦ مُشۡفِقُونَ,"He knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them[14]. They cannot intercede except for whom He pleases, and they are fearful in awe of Him.",[14] See footnote 2:255.
21,29,۞ وَمَن يَقُلۡ مِنۡهُمۡ إِنِّيٓ إِلَٰهٞ مِّن دُونِهِۦ فَذَٰلِكَ نَجۡزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَۚ كَذَٰلِكَ نَجۡزِي ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"If anyone of them were to say, “I am god besides Him,” We would punish him with Hell. This is how We punish the wrongdoers.",
21,30,أَوَلَمۡ يَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓاْ أَنَّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ كَانَتَا رَتۡقٗا فَفَتَقۡنَٰهُمَاۖ وَجَعَلۡنَا مِنَ ٱلۡمَآءِ كُلَّ شَيۡءٍ حَيٍّۚ أَفَلَا يُؤۡمِنُونَ,Are the disbelievers not aware that the heavens and earth were joined together and then We split them apart? We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?,
21,31,وَجَعَلۡنَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ رَوَٰسِيَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِهِمۡ وَجَعَلۡنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجٗا سُبُلٗا لَّعَلَّهُمۡ يَهۡتَدُونَ,"We have set on the earth firm mountains so it does not shake with them, and We have made therein broad pathways so that they may find their way.",
21,32,وَجَعَلۡنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ سَقۡفٗا مَّحۡفُوظٗاۖ وَهُمۡ عَنۡ ءَايَٰتِهَا مُعۡرِضُونَ,"And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, yet they turn away from its signs[15].",[15] Such as the sun and the moon.
21,33,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلَّيۡلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ وَٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَۖ كُلّٞ فِي فَلَكٖ يَسۡبَحُونَ,"It is He Who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon – each floating in its orbit.",
21,34,وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا لِبَشَرٖ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ ٱلۡخُلۡدَۖ أَفَإِيْن مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلۡخَٰلِدُونَ,"We did not grant immortality to any human being before you [O Prophet]. So if you die, will they live forever?",
21,35,كُلُّ نَفۡسٖ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلۡمَوۡتِۗ وَنَبۡلُوكُم بِٱلشَّرِّ وَٱلۡخَيۡرِ فِتۡنَةٗۖ وَإِلَيۡنَا تُرۡجَعُونَ,"Every soul will taste death; We test you with bad and good as a trial, then to Us you will all be returned.",
21,36,وَإِذَا رَءَاكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓاْ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلَّا هُزُوًا أَهَٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَذۡكُرُ ءَالِهَتَكُمۡ وَهُم بِذِكۡرِ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ هُمۡ كَٰفِرُونَ,"When the disbelievers see you, they only take you in ridicule, [saying], “Is this the one who speaks ill of your gods?” while they reject even the mention of the Most Compassionate.",
21,37,خُلِقَ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ مِنۡ عَجَلٖۚ سَأُوْرِيكُمۡ ءَايَٰتِي فَلَا تَسۡتَعۡجِلُونِ,"Man is created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten them.",
21,38,وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا ٱلۡوَعۡدُ إِن كُنتُمۡ صَٰدِقِينَ,"They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”",
21,39,لَوۡ يَعۡلَمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ حِينَ لَا يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَلَا عَن ظُهُورِهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ يُنصَرُونَ,"If only the disbelievers knew the moment when they would be unable to ward the Fire off their faces or their backs, nor would they be helped[16].","[16] The completion of the sentence is ""...they would not be asking for the punishment."""
21,40,بَلۡ تَأۡتِيهِم بَغۡتَةٗ فَتَبۡهَتُهُمۡ فَلَا يَسۡتَطِيعُونَ رَدَّهَا وَلَا هُمۡ يُنظَرُونَ,"Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and stun them; they will not be able to avert it, nor will they be given respite.",
21,41,وَلَقَدِ ٱسۡتُهۡزِئَ بِرُسُلٖ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُواْ مِنۡهُم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِۦ يَسۡتَهۡزِءُونَ,"Indeed, there were messengers before you who were ridiculed, but those who mocked them were encompassed by what they used to ridicule.",
21,42,قُلۡ مَن يَكۡلَؤُكُم بِٱلَّيۡلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ مِنَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِۚ بَلۡ هُمۡ عَن ذِكۡرِ رَبِّهِم مُّعۡرِضُونَ,"Say, “Who can protect you by night and by day against the Most Compassionate?” Yet they turn away from the admonition of their Lord.",
21,43,أَمۡ لَهُمۡ ءَالِهَةٞ تَمۡنَعُهُم مِّن دُونِنَاۚ لَا يَسۡتَطِيعُونَ نَصۡرَ أَنفُسِهِمۡ وَلَا هُم مِّنَّا يُصۡحَبُونَ,"Do they have gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot even help themselves, nor will they be protected from Us.",
21,44,بَلۡ مَتَّعۡنَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَءَابَآءَهُمۡ حَتَّىٰ طَالَ عَلَيۡهِمُ ٱلۡعُمُرُۗ أَفَلَا يَرَوۡنَ أَنَّا نَأۡتِي ٱلۡأَرۡضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنۡ أَطۡرَافِهَآۚ أَفَهُمُ ٱلۡغَٰلِبُونَ,"Nevertheless, We have provided for them and their forefathers luxuries which they enjoyed for a long time. Do they not see that We gradually reduce the land from its outlying sides?[17] Is it they who will then prevail?",[17] See footnote 13:41.
21,45,قُلۡ إِنَّمَآ أُنذِرُكُم بِٱلۡوَحۡيِۚ وَلَا يَسۡمَعُ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا مَا يُنذَرُونَ,"Say, “I only warn you by divine revelation.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned.",
21,46,وَلَئِن مَّسَّتۡهُمۡ نَفۡحَةٞ مِّنۡ عَذَابِ رَبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ يَٰوَيۡلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَٰلِمِينَ,"If a mere breath of your Lord’s torment were to touch them, they would surely say, “Woe to us! We were indeed wrongdoers.”",
21,47,وَنَضَعُ ٱلۡمَوَٰزِينَ ٱلۡقِسۡطَ لِيَوۡمِ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِ فَلَا تُظۡلَمُ نَفۡسٞ شَيۡـٔٗاۖ وَإِن كَانَ مِثۡقَالَ حَبَّةٖ مِّنۡ خَرۡدَلٍ أَتَيۡنَا بِهَاۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَٰسِبِينَ,"We will place the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection, and no soul will be wronged in the least. Even if a deed is the weight of a mustard seed[18], We will bring it forth. Sufficient are We as Reckoners.","[18] i.e., as small or insignificant as a mustard seed."
21,48,وَلَقَدۡ ءَاتَيۡنَا مُوسَىٰ وَهَٰرُونَ ٱلۡفُرۡقَانَ وَضِيَآءٗ وَذِكۡرٗا لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ,"We certainly gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, shining light and admonition[19] for the righteous,",[19] These are Torah’s three qualities.

21,50,وَهَٰذَا ذِكۡرٞ مُّبَارَكٌ أَنزَلۡنَٰهُۚ أَفَأَنتُمۡ لَهُۥ مُنكِرُونَ,And this [Qur’an] is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Are you still denying it[21]?,"[21] i.e., pretending ignorance or refusing to acknowledge it?"
21,51,۞ وَلَقَدۡ ءَاتَيۡنَآ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ رُشۡدَهُۥ مِن قَبۡلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِۦ عَٰلِمِينَ,"Indeed, We had given Abraham sound judgment before[22], for We know him well.","[22] i.e., before Moses, or in his early youth."
21,52,إِذۡ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوۡمِهِۦ مَا هَٰذِهِ ٱلتَّمَاثِيلُ ٱلَّتِيٓ أَنتُمۡ لَهَا عَٰكِفُونَ,"When he said to his father and his people, “What are these statues to which you are so devoted?”",
21,53,قَالُواْ وَجَدۡنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا لَهَا عَٰبِدِينَ,"They said, “We found our forefathers worshiping them.”",
21,54,قَالَ لَقَدۡ كُنتُمۡ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمۡ فِي ضَلَٰلٖ مُّبِينٖ,"He said, “Indeed, you and your forefathers were clearly misguided.”",
21,55,قَالُوٓاْ أَجِئۡتَنَا بِٱلۡحَقِّ أَمۡ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱللَّٰعِبِينَ,"They said, “Have you come to us with the truth, or are you joking?”",
21,56,قَالَ بَل رَّبُّكُمۡ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَهُنَّ وَأَنَا۠ عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكُم مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,"He said, “Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth, Who created them, and I am one of those who bear witness to it.",
21,57,وَتَٱللَّهِ لَأَكِيدَنَّ أَصۡنَٰمَكُم بَعۡدَ أَن تُوَلُّواْ مُدۡبِرِينَ,"By Allah, I will surely plot against your idols after you have turned and gone away.”",
21,58,فَجَعَلَهُمۡ جُذَٰذًا إِلَّا كَبِيرٗا لَّهُمۡ لَعَلَّهُمۡ إِلَيۡهِ يَرۡجِعُونَ,"So he broke them into pieces, except the biggest of them, so that they might come back to it.",
21,59,قَالُواْ مَن فَعَلَ هَٰذَا بِـَٔالِهَتِنَآ إِنَّهُۥ لَمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"They said, “Who has done this to our gods? He is indeed one of the wrongdoers.”",

21,63,قَالَ بَلۡ فَعَلَهُۥ كَبِيرُهُمۡ هَٰذَا فَسۡـَٔلُوهُمۡ إِن كَانُواْ يَنطِقُونَ,"He said, “Rather, it was this biggest one who did it. So ask them, if they can speak!”",
21,64,فَرَجَعُوٓاْ إِلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمۡ فَقَالُوٓاْ إِنَّكُمۡ أَنتُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"So they turned back to one another, and said, “Indeed, it is you who are the wrongdoers.”",
21,65,ثُمَّ نُكِسُواْ عَلَىٰ رُءُوسِهِمۡ لَقَدۡ عَلِمۡتَ مَا هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ يَنطِقُونَ,"Then they turned to their obstinacy[24], [saying], “You already know that they cannot speak.”",[24] After first admitting their error.
21,66,قَالَ أَفَتَعۡبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكُمۡ شَيۡـٔٗا وَلَا يَضُرُّكُمۡ,"Abraham said, “Do you then worship besides Allah that which can neither benefit nor harm you in the least?",
