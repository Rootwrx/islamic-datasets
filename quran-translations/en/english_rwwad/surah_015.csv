15,1,الٓرۚ تِلۡكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ وَقُرۡءَانٖ مُّبِينٖ,Alif Lām Ra[1]. These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur’an.,[1] See footnote 2:1.
15,2,رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوۡ كَانُواْ مُسۡلِمِينَ,The disbelievers will soon[2] wish that they were Muslims.,[2] On the Judgment Day or upon their death.
15,3,ذَرۡهُمۡ يَأۡكُلُواْ وَيَتَمَتَّعُواْ وَيُلۡهِهِمُ ٱلۡأَمَلُۖ فَسَوۡفَ يَعۡلَمُونَ,Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted with false hope; they will come to know.,
15,4,وَمَآ أَهۡلَكۡنَا مِن قَرۡيَةٍ إِلَّا وَلَهَا كِتَابٞ مَّعۡلُومٞ,We never destroyed any town except that it had a destined time.,
15,5,مَّا تَسۡبِقُ مِنۡ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسۡتَـٔۡخِرُونَ,"No nation can advance its appointed time, nor can they delay it.",
15,6,وَقَالُواْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِي نُزِّلَ عَلَيۡهِ ٱلذِّكۡرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجۡنُونٞ,"They say, “O you to whom the Reminder has been sent down, You are surely insane[3]!","[3] These deriding remarks were very hard on the Prophet (ﷺ), and Allah consoles him in this surah."
15,7,لَّوۡمَا تَأۡتِينَا بِٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰدِقِينَ,"Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are truthful?”",
15,8,مَا نُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ إِلَّا بِٱلۡحَقِّ وَمَا كَانُوٓاْ إِذٗا مُّنظَرِينَ,"We do not send down the angels except for a just cause, and then [the disbelievers] would be granted no respite[4].","[4] i.e., then they would be destroyed on the spot."
15,9,إِنَّا نَحۡنُ نَزَّلۡنَا ٱلذِّكۡرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَحَٰفِظُونَ,"It is We Who have sent down the Reminder[5], and it is We Who will preserve it[6].","[5] As a reminder for people.  [6] From distortion, alteration, addition, and omission. More than 1400 years have elapsed and not a single word of this Qur’an has been changed, although enemies have tried their utmost."
15,10,وَلَقَدۡ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مِن قَبۡلِكَ فِي شِيَعِ ٱلۡأَوَّلِينَ,We did send messengers before you among the factions of early peoples.,
15,11,وَمَا يَأۡتِيهِم مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا كَانُواْ بِهِۦ يَسۡتَهۡزِءُونَ,No messenger came to them except that they ridiculed him.,
15,12,كَذَٰلِكَ نَسۡلُكُهُۥ فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلۡمُجۡرِمِينَ,This is how We let this [denial] enter the hearts of the wicked[7].,[7] For they rebelled against the Truth and did not submit to it.
15,13,لَا يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِهِۦ وَقَدۡ خَلَتۡ سُنَّةُ ٱلۡأَوَّلِينَ,"They will not believe in it, although the examples of the earlier people are well established.",
15,14,وَلَوۡ فَتَحۡنَا عَلَيۡهِم بَابٗا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَظَلُّواْ فِيهِ يَعۡرُجُونَ,"Even if We were to open for them a gateway to the heaven, through which they kept ascending,",
15,15,لَقَالُوٓاْ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتۡ أَبۡصَٰرُنَا بَلۡ نَحۡنُ قَوۡمٞ مَّسۡحُورُونَ,"they would still say, “Our eyes have been dazzled; rather, we have been bewitched.”",
15,16,وَلَقَدۡ جَعَلۡنَا فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ بُرُوجٗا وَزَيَّنَّٰهَا لِلنَّٰظِرِينَ,"We have placed constellations in the heaven and adorned it for the onlookers,",
15,17,وَحَفِظۡنَٰهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيۡطَٰنٖ رَّجِيمٍ,"and We have guarded it from every accursed devil,",
15,18,إِلَّا مَنِ ٱسۡتَرَقَ ٱلسَّمۡعَ فَأَتۡبَعَهُۥ شِهَابٞ مُّبِينٞ,"except the one who manages to eavesdrop, he will then be pursued by a visible burning flame.",
15,19,وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ مَدَدۡنَٰهَا وَأَلۡقَيۡنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِيَ وَأَنۢبَتۡنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ مَّوۡزُونٖ,"As for the earth, We have spread it out and placed therein firm mountains, and caused to grow therein everything in due proportion.",
15,20,وَجَعَلۡنَا لَكُمۡ فِيهَا مَعَٰيِشَ وَمَن لَّسۡتُمۡ لَهُۥ بِرَٰزِقِينَ,And We have made therein for you means of sustenance and for those[8] whom you do not provide.,"[8] i.e., the children, servants, and livestock that one is blessed with."
15,21,وَإِن مِّن شَيۡءٍ إِلَّا عِندَنَا خَزَآئِنُهُۥ وَمَا نُنَزِّلُهُۥٓ إِلَّا بِقَدَرٖ مَّعۡلُومٖ,"There is nothing except that We have its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a determined measure.",
15,22,وَأَرۡسَلۡنَا ٱلرِّيَٰحَ لَوَٰقِحَ فَأَنزَلۡنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءٗ فَأَسۡقَيۡنَٰكُمُوهُ وَمَآ أَنتُمۡ لَهُۥ بِخَٰزِنِينَ,"And We send fertilizing winds[9], and send down rain from the sky for you to drink, and it is not you who could store it.",[9] Causing precipitation in rainclouds or carrying pollen.
15,23,وَإِنَّا لَنَحۡنُ نُحۡيِۦ وَنُمِيتُ وَنَحۡنُ ٱلۡوَٰرِثُونَ,"Indeed, it is We Who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritors [of all things].",
15,24,وَلَقَدۡ عَلِمۡنَا ٱلۡمُسۡتَقۡدِمِينَ مِنكُمۡ وَلَقَدۡ عَلِمۡنَا ٱلۡمُسۡتَـٔۡخِرِينَ,We surely know those of you who have gone before and those who are yet to come.,
15,25,وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَحۡشُرُهُمۡۚ إِنَّهُۥ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٞ,"It is your Lord Who will gather them together. He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
15,26,وَلَقَدۡ خَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡإِنسَٰنَ مِن صَلۡصَٰلٖ مِّنۡ حَمَإٖ مَّسۡنُونٖ,"We have created man from sounding clay, made of aging mud[10].",[10] Salsāl: clay left to ferment and turn hard so that it clinks when tapped on. Hama’: transformed or blackened clay. Masnūn: the smell of which has turned foul or left for some time.
15,27,وَٱلۡجَآنَّ خَلَقۡنَٰهُ مِن قَبۡلُ مِن نَّارِ ٱلسَّمُومِ,"And the jinn[11] We created before that, from smokeless fire.","[11] The jinn: They are the creatures of Allah, who are different from humans. There are some among them who are righteous, while others are wicked. They are not humans or a species of humans."
15,28,وَإِذۡ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنِّي خَٰلِقُۢ بَشَرٗا مِّن صَلۡصَٰلٖ مِّنۡ حَمَإٖ مَّسۡنُونٖ,"And [remember] when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from sounding clay, made of aging mud.",
15,29,فَإِذَا سَوَّيۡتُهُۥ وَنَفَخۡتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِي فَقَعُواْ لَهُۥ سَٰجِدِينَ,"When I have shaped him and breathed into him of My spirit[12], then fall down before him in prostration.”","[12] The spirit which Allah created for that body, not His own Spirit (as some mistakenly believe). Allah attributed it to Himself as a sign of honoring him, as in nāqat Allah (the she-camel of Allah)."
15,30,فَسَجَدَ ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ كُلُّهُمۡ أَجۡمَعُونَ,"Thereupon, all of the angels fell down in prostration,",
15,31,إِلَّآ إِبۡلِيسَ أَبَىٰٓ أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"except for Iblīs, who refused to be with those who prostrated[13].",[13] See 18:50.
15,32,قَالَ يَٰٓإِبۡلِيسُ مَا لَكَ أَلَّا تَكُونَ مَعَ ٱلسَّٰجِدِينَ,"Allah said, “O Iblīs, what is the matter with you that you were not with those who prostrated?”",
15,33,قَالَ لَمۡ أَكُن لِّأَسۡجُدَ لِبَشَرٍ خَلَقۡتَهُۥ مِن صَلۡصَٰلٖ مِّنۡ حَمَإٖ مَّسۡنُونٖ,"He said, “I am not such to prostrate before a human whom You created from sounding clay, made of aging mud.[14]”",[14] He said: “I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.” See 7:12.
15,34,قَالَ فَٱخۡرُجۡ مِنۡهَا فَإِنَّكَ رَجِيمٞ,"He said, “Then get out of here[15], for you are accursed,","[15] i.e., from the heaven."
15,35,وَإِنَّ عَلَيۡكَ ٱللَّعۡنَةَ إِلَىٰ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ,and the curse will be upon you until the Day of Judgment.”,
15,36,قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرۡنِيٓ إِلَىٰ يَوۡمِ يُبۡعَثُونَ,"Iblīs said, “My Lord, then grant me respite until the Day they are resurrected.”",
15,37,قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلۡمُنظَرِينَ,"Allah said, “You are of those who are granted respite[16],",[16] As a trial; to sift out His obedient servants from those who obey Iblīs.
15,38,إِلَىٰ يَوۡمِ ٱلۡوَقۡتِ ٱلۡمَعۡلُومِ,until the Day of the Appointed Time[17].”,"[17] i.e., the Day of Judgment."
15,39,قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَغۡوَيۡتَنِي لَأُزَيِّنَنَّ لَهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَلَأُغۡوِيَنَّهُمۡ أَجۡمَعِينَ,"He said, “My Lord, since You have sent me astray[18], I will surely make [sins] alluring to them on earth and mislead them all,",[18] Satan set the record for being the first to use predestination (al-qadar) as a pretext for disobeying Allah’s command (al-’amr).
15,40,إِلَّا عِبَادَكَ مِنۡهُمُ ٱلۡمُخۡلَصِينَ,except for Your chosen slaves among them.”,
15,41,قَالَ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٌ عَلَيَّ مُسۡتَقِيمٌ,"Allah said, “This is a straight path leading to Me.",
15,42,إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيۡسَ لَكَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ سُلۡطَٰنٌ إِلَّا مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلۡغَاوِينَ,"You will have no authority over My slaves, except the deviants who follow you.",
15,43,وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمَوۡعِدُهُمۡ أَجۡمَعِينَ,"And Hell is certainly the promised place for them, all together.",
15,44,لَهَا سَبۡعَةُ أَبۡوَٰبٖ لِّكُلِّ بَابٖ مِّنۡهُمۡ جُزۡءٞ مَّقۡسُومٌ,It has seven gates[19]; each gate will have its allotted share of them.”,[19] The doors of Hell are plenty; according to the crime.
15,45,إِنَّ ٱلۡمُتَّقِينَ فِي جَنَّٰتٖ وَعُيُونٍ,The righteous will be in gardens and springs.,
15,46,ٱدۡخُلُوهَا بِسَلَٰمٍ ءَامِنِينَ,“Enter in peace and safety[20]!”,"[20] i.e., safe from all ills, troubles, and all that might put a dent in their happiness."
15,47,وَنَزَعۡنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنۡ غِلٍّ إِخۡوَٰنًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٖ مُّتَقَٰبِلِينَ,"We will remove all ill feelings from their hearts[21]; like brothers, seated on couches facing one another.","[21] This is in perfection of their bliss, by having no ill-will whatsoever."
15,48,لَا يَمَسُّهُمۡ فِيهَا نَصَبٞ وَمَا هُم مِّنۡهَا بِمُخۡرَجِينَ,"No fatigue will ever touch them therein[22], nor will they ever be made to leave.","[22] i.e., untainted by drawbacks of toil or uneasiness about the future."
15,49,۞ نَبِّئۡ عِبَادِيٓ أَنِّيٓ أَنَا ٱلۡغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Inform My slaves that I am indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful,",
15,50,وَأَنَّ عَذَابِي هُوَ ٱلۡعَذَابُ ٱلۡأَلِيمُ,and that My punishment is the most painful punishment.,
15,51,وَنَبِّئۡهُمۡ عَن ضَيۡفِ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ,And inform them about the guests of Abraham.,
15,52,إِذۡ دَخَلُواْ عَلَيۡهِ فَقَالُواْ سَلَٰمٗا قَالَ إِنَّا مِنكُمۡ وَجِلُونَ,"When they entered upon him and said, “Peace!” He said, “We are afraid of you[23].”",[23] When he saw that their hands did not reach the roasted calf he presented to them.
15,53,قَالُواْ لَا تَوۡجَلۡ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلَٰمٍ عَلِيمٖ,"They said, “Do not be afraid; We give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable boy[24].”","[24] i.e., Isaac; of great religious knowledge."
15,54,قَالَ أَبَشَّرۡتُمُونِي عَلَىٰٓ أَن مَّسَّنِيَ ٱلۡكِبَرُ فَبِمَ تُبَشِّرُونَ,"He said, “Do you give me glad tidings despite my old age? What glad tidings are you giving me?”",
15,55,قَالُواْ بَشَّرۡنَٰكَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ فَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ ٱلۡقَٰنِطِينَ,"They said, “We have given you glad tidings in truth, so do not be of those who despair[25].”",[25] Abraham (عليه السلام) might have shown signs of doubt at believing such news.
15,56,قَالَ وَمَن يَقۡنَطُ مِن رَّحۡمَةِ رَبِّهِۦٓ إِلَّا ٱلضَّآلُّونَ,"He said, “Who would despair of his Lord’s mercy except those who are misguided[26]?”",[26] Abraham’s (عليه السلام) reply disproves the assumption that he was despondent of Allah’s Mercy.
15,57,قَالَ فَمَا خَطۡبُكُمۡ أَيُّهَا ٱلۡمُرۡسَلُونَ,"He said, “So, what is your mission, O messengers?”",
15,58,قَالُوٓاْ إِنَّآ أُرۡسِلۡنَآ إِلَىٰ قَوۡمٖ مُّجۡرِمِينَ,"They said, “We have been sent to a wicked people[27],","[27] i.e., the people of the prophet Lot (عليه السلام)."
15,59,إِلَّآ ءَالَ لُوطٍ إِنَّا لَمُنَجُّوهُمۡ أَجۡمَعِينَ,"except the household of Lot; we will surely save them all,",
15,60,إِلَّا ٱمۡرَأَتَهُۥ قَدَّرۡنَآ إِنَّهَا لَمِنَ ٱلۡغَٰبِرِينَ,except his wife[28]; We have decreed that she will be among those who stay behind.”,[28] For she has collaborated with the evildoers.
15,61,فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ءَالَ لُوطٍ ٱلۡمُرۡسَلُونَ,"When the messengers came to the household of Lot[29],","[29] Details of the first three nations destroyed are given in this and the following verses, which were en route of the famous trading journeys of the Qurayshites: the people of Prophet Lot, those of the thicket (the people of Shu‘ayb), and those of Hegra (Madā’in Sālih)."
15,62,قَالَ إِنَّكُمۡ قَوۡمٞ مُّنكَرُونَ,"he said, “You are unfamiliar people.”",
15,63,قَالُواْ بَلۡ جِئۡنَٰكَ بِمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَمۡتَرُونَ,"They said, “We have come to you with that [punishment][30] which they have doubted.","[30] i.e., the divine punishment."
15,64,وَأَتَيۡنَٰكَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ وَإِنَّا لَصَٰدِقُونَ,"We have come to you with the truth, and we are certainly truthful.",
15,65,فَأَسۡرِ بِأَهۡلِكَ بِقِطۡعٖ مِّنَ ٱلَّيۡلِ وَٱتَّبِعۡ أَدۡبَٰرَهُمۡ وَلَا يَلۡتَفِتۡ مِنكُمۡ أَحَدٞ وَٱمۡضُواْ حَيۡثُ تُؤۡمَرُونَ,"So travel with your household in the dark of night and go behind them; none of you should look back[31], and keep going to where you are commanded.”","[31] To be more persistent in their walk and strike some distance before dawn, or not to be frightened and traumatized by catching sight of the horrific punishment of their folks."
15,66,وَقَضَيۡنَآ إِلَيۡهِ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡأَمۡرَ أَنَّ دَابِرَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ مَقۡطُوعٞ مُّصۡبِحِينَ,We conveyed this decree to him that these [people] will be exterminated by early morning.”,
15,67,وَجَآءَ أَهۡلُ ٱلۡمَدِينَةِ يَسۡتَبۡشِرُونَ,The people of the city came [to Lot] rejoicing[32].,[32] At the news of his visitors.
15,68,قَالَ إِنَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ ضَيۡفِي فَلَا تَفۡضَحُونِ,"Lot said, “These are my guests, so do not bring shame on me.",
15,69,وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلَا تُخۡزُونِ,Fear Allah and do not disgrace me.”,
15,70,قَالُوٓاْ أَوَلَمۡ نَنۡهَكَ عَنِ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ,"They said, “Did we not forbid you from [protecting] people?”",
15,71,قَالَ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ بَنَاتِيٓ إِن كُنتُمۡ فَٰعِلِينَ,"He said, “These are my daughters [to marry], if you must[33].”","[33] i.e., the women of my community or my own daughters in a lawful marriage."
15,72,لَعَمۡرُكَ إِنَّهُمۡ لَفِي سَكۡرَتِهِمۡ يَعۡمَهُونَ,"By your life [O prophet], they were wandering blindly in their intoxication [of lust][34].","[34] Admonition is of no use, no matter how reasonable it is, when someone is drunk in their lust."
15,73,فَأَخَذَتۡهُمُ ٱلصَّيۡحَةُ مُشۡرِقِينَ,"So they were seized by the blast at sunrise,",
15,74,فَجَعَلۡنَا عَٰلِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمۡطَرۡنَا عَلَيۡهِمۡ حِجَارَةٗ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ,and We turned their cities upside down[35] and rained down on them stones of baked clay.,"[35] Their nature was twisted, so their punishment was of its like."
15,75,إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَأٓيَٰتٖ لِّلۡمُتَوَسِّمِينَ,"Indeed, there are signs in this for those who discern[36].","[36] i.e., those who look deeply into signifying signs."
15,76,وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٖ مُّقِيمٍ,And their place is located by a known route[37].,"[37] i.e., on the highway to the Levant, where the Dead Sea is now."
15,77,إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَأٓيَةٗ لِّلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ,"Indeed, there are signs in this for the believers.",
15,78,وَإِن كَانَ أَصۡحَٰبُ ٱلۡأَيۡكَةِ لَظَٰلِمِينَ,And the people of the Forest[38] were wrongdoers.,"[38] i.e., the people of the thicket, i.e. the people of Prophet Shu‘ayb (عليه السلام) who lived in Madian, not far from the people of Lot."
15,79,فَٱنتَقَمۡنَا مِنۡهُمۡ وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٖ مُّبِينٖ,"So We punished them in retribution, and both [places][39] are by a clear highway.","[39] i.e., both the dwellings of the people of Prophet Lot (عليه السلام) and Prophet Shu‘ayb (عليه السلام)."
15,80,وَلَقَدۡ كَذَّبَ أَصۡحَٰبُ ٱلۡحِجۡرِ ٱلۡمُرۡسَلِينَ,Surely the people of Al-Hijr[40] also rejected the messengers.,"[40] i.e., Thamūd: the people of Prophet Sālih (عليه السلام)."
15,81,وَءَاتَيۡنَٰهُمۡ ءَايَٰتِنَا فَكَانُواْ عَنۡهَا مُعۡرِضِينَ,"We gave them Our signs, but they kept turning away from them.",
15,82,وَكَانُواْ يَنۡحِتُونَ مِنَ ٱلۡجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا ءَامِنِينَ,"They carved houses in the mountains, feeling secure[41].",[41] These mountainous strongholds gave them a false sense of security against any consequences.
15,83,فَأَخَذَتۡهُمُ ٱلصَّيۡحَةُ مُصۡبِحِينَ,So they were seized by the blast early in the morning.,
15,84,فَمَآ أَغۡنَىٰ عَنۡهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَكۡسِبُونَ,Nothing of what they earned was of any avail to them.,
15,85,وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَمَا بَيۡنَهُمَآ إِلَّا بِٱلۡحَقِّۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لَأٓتِيَةٞۖ فَٱصۡفَحِ ٱلصَّفۡحَ ٱلۡجَمِيلَ,"We have not created the heavens and earth and all that is between them except for a true purpose. The Hour is certainly coming, so bear with them graciously[42].","[42] This final passage puts things into perspective, addressing the Prophet (ﷺ) - that all people, including those who tormented him, will be justly held accountable for their deeds, and asking him to overlook their taunts and not censure them for it."
15,86,إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلۡخَلَّٰقُ ٱلۡعَلِيمُ,"Indeed, your Lord is the Absolute Creator, the All-Knowing.",
15,87,وَلَقَدۡ ءَاتَيۡنَٰكَ سَبۡعٗا مِّنَ ٱلۡمَثَانِي وَٱلۡقُرۡءَانَ ٱلۡعَظِيمَ,We have surely given you the seven oft-repeated verses[43] and the great Qur’an.,"[43] i.e., Seven of al-Mathāni (seven repeatedly recited verses), referring to Surat al-Fātihah."
15,88,لَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيۡنَيۡكَ إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعۡنَا بِهِۦٓ أَزۡوَٰجٗا مِّنۡهُمۡ وَلَا تَحۡزَنۡ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَٱخۡفِضۡ جَنَاحَكَ لِلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ,"Do not look longingly at the pleasures We have given certain classes[44] of them[45], nor grieve over them[46], but lower your wing [in humility] to the believers[47].","[44] Azwāj: literally means pairs; here it means those who are alike in prosperity, as not all of them were rich and prosperous. [45] So as to test them therein.  [46] The Prophet (ﷺ) felt sad that they would not believe and save themselves from Hellfire.  [47] The favor of the Qur’an far surpasses all other favors and worldly gains."
15,89,وَقُلۡ إِنِّيٓ أَنَا ٱلنَّذِيرُ ٱلۡمُبِينُ,"And say, “I am indeed a clear warner.” –",
15,90,كَمَآ أَنزَلۡنَا عَلَى ٱلۡمُقۡتَسِمِينَ,"just as We sent down [punishment] upon those who divided [their religion][48],","[48] i.e., the People of the Book, who accepted some portions of the Torah and rejected some."
15,91,ٱلَّذِينَ جَعَلُواْ ٱلۡقُرۡءَانَ عِضِينَ,those who split the Qur’an into different portions[49].,"[49] i.e., calling it magic, divination, or poetry."
15,92,فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسۡـَٔلَنَّهُمۡ أَجۡمَعِينَ,"By your Lord, We will surely question them all",
15,93,عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعۡمَلُونَ,concerning what they used to do.,
