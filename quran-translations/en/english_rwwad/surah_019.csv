19,2,ذِكۡرُ رَحۡمَتِ رَبِّكَ عَبۡدَهُۥ زَكَرِيَّآ,"This is a reminder of the mercy of your Lord to His slave Zachariah,",
19,3,إِذۡ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥ نِدَآءً خَفِيّٗا,When he called upon his Lord in private.,
19,4,قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَهَنَ ٱلۡعَظۡمُ مِنِّي وَٱشۡتَعَلَ ٱلرَّأۡسُ شَيۡبٗا وَلَمۡ أَكُنۢ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّٗا,"He said, “My Lord, my bones have grown feeble, and gray hair has spread across my head,[2] yet never have I been disappointed in my prayer to You, my Lord.","[2] Lit., ""ignited."" The spread of white hair across the head is likened to igniting of fire in the bush."
19,5,وَإِنِّي خِفۡتُ ٱلۡمَوَٰلِيَ مِن وَرَآءِي وَكَانَتِ ٱمۡرَأَتِي عَاقِرٗا فَهَبۡ لِي مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيّٗا,"And I fear my kinsmen after me,[3] and my wife is barren; so grant me from Yourself an heir,","[3] i.e., my successors."
19,6,يَرِثُنِي وَيَرِثُ مِنۡ ءَالِ يَعۡقُوبَۖ وَٱجۡعَلۡهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّٗا,"who will inherit [prophethood] from me and from the house of Jacob, and make him, O Lord, well pleasing to You.”",
19,7,يَٰزَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلَٰمٍ ٱسۡمُهُۥ يَحۡيَىٰ لَمۡ نَجۡعَل لَّهُۥ مِن قَبۡلُ سَمِيّٗا,"[Allah said], “O Zachariah, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be John – a name that We have not given to anyone before.”",
19,8,قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلَٰمٞ وَكَانَتِ ٱمۡرَأَتِي عَاقِرٗا وَقَدۡ بَلَغۡتُ مِنَ ٱلۡكِبَرِ عِتِيّٗا,"He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have reached an extremely old age?”",
19,9,قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٞ وَقَدۡ خَلَقۡتُكَ مِن قَبۡلُ وَلَمۡ تَكُ شَيۡـٔٗا,"[The angel] said, “Thus it will be; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me; I did create you before when you were nothing.’”",
19,10,قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجۡعَل لِّيٓ ءَايَةٗۖ قَالَ ءَايَتُكَ أَلَّا تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلَٰثَ لَيَالٖ سَوِيّٗا,"Zachariah said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three nights,[4] despite being sound.”","[4] i.e., without being ill."
19,11,فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوۡمِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلۡمِحۡرَابِ فَأَوۡحَىٰٓ إِلَيۡهِمۡ أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكۡرَةٗ وَعَشِيّٗا,Thereupon he came out to his people from the sanctuary and signaled to them to glorify Allah morning and evening.,
19,12,يَٰيَحۡيَىٰ خُذِ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ بِقُوَّةٖۖ وَءَاتَيۡنَٰهُ ٱلۡحُكۡمَ صَبِيّٗا,"[Allah said], “O John, hold the Scripture with all your strength.” And We gave him wisdom when he was still a child,",
19,13,وَحَنَانٗا مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَوٰةٗۖ وَكَانَ تَقِيّٗا,"as We made him compassionate and righteous, and he was fearing Allah,",
19,14,وَبَرَّۢا بِوَٰلِدَيۡهِ وَلَمۡ يَكُن جَبَّارًا عَصِيّٗا,"and dutiful to his parents, and he was not an oppressor or disobedient.",
19,15,وَسَلَٰمٌ عَلَيۡهِ يَوۡمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوۡمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوۡمَ يُبۡعَثُ حَيّٗا,"Peace be on him the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he will be raised up to life again!",
19,16,وَٱذۡكُرۡ فِي ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ مَرۡيَمَ إِذِ ٱنتَبَذَتۡ مِنۡ أَهۡلِهَا مَكَانٗا شَرۡقِيّٗا,And mention in the Book [the story of] Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place towards the east.,
19,17,فَٱتَّخَذَتۡ مِن دُونِهِمۡ حِجَابٗا فَأَرۡسَلۡنَآ إِلَيۡهَا رُوحَنَا فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَرٗا سَوِيّٗا,"She screened herself from them, then We sent to her Our Spirit [Gabriel] and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being.",
19,18,قَالَتۡ إِنِّيٓ أَعُوذُ بِٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّٗا,"She said, “I seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you; [do not approach me] if you fear Allah.”",
19,19,قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلَٰمٗا زَكِيّٗا,"He said, “I am only a messenger from your Lord to grant you a righteous son.”",
19,20,قَالَتۡ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلَٰمٞ وَلَمۡ يَمۡسَسۡنِي بَشَرٞ وَلَمۡ أَكُ بَغِيّٗا,"She said, “How can I have a son when no man has touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?”",
19,21,قَالَ كَذَٰلِكِ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٞۖ وَلِنَجۡعَلَهُۥٓ ءَايَةٗ لِّلنَّاسِ وَرَحۡمَةٗ مِّنَّاۚ وَكَانَ أَمۡرٗا مَّقۡضِيّٗا,"He said, “Thus it will be; your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me; We make him a sign for people and a mercy from Us. This matter has already been decreed.’”",
19,22,۞ فَحَمَلَتۡهُ فَٱنتَبَذَتۡ بِهِۦ مَكَانٗا قَصِيّٗا,So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a distant place.[5],"[5] i.e., Bethlehem, around 6 miles (10 km) to the south of Jerusalem."
19,23,فَأَجَآءَهَا ٱلۡمَخَاضُ إِلَىٰ جِذۡعِ ٱلنَّخۡلَةِ قَالَتۡ يَٰلَيۡتَنِي مِتُّ قَبۡلَ هَٰذَا وَكُنتُ نَسۡيٗا مَّنسِيّٗا,"The pains of labor drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, “Oh, would that I had died before this and had been completely forgotten!”",
19,24,فَنَادَىٰهَا مِن تَحۡتِهَآ أَلَّا تَحۡزَنِي قَدۡ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحۡتَكِ سَرِيّٗا,"Then he[6] called her from beneath her, “Do not grieve; your Lord has provided a stream beneath you.","[6] i.e., the archangel Gabriel or the baby."
19,25,وَهُزِّيٓ إِلَيۡكِ بِجِذۡعِ ٱلنَّخۡلَةِ تُسَٰقِطۡ عَلَيۡكِ رُطَبٗا جَنِيّٗا,Shake the trunk of the palm tree towards yourself; fresh ripe dates will drop upon you.,
19,26,فَكُلِي وَٱشۡرَبِي وَقَرِّي عَيۡنٗاۖ فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ ٱلۡبَشَرِ أَحَدٗا فَقُولِيٓ إِنِّي نَذَرۡتُ لِلرَّحۡمَٰنِ صَوۡمٗا فَلَنۡ أُكَلِّمَ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ إِنسِيّٗا,"Eat and drink, and be glad. And if you see any human being, say, ‘I have vowed silence[7] to the Most Compassionate, so I will not talk to any human being today.’”","[7] Sawm: literally means to abstain or fast from food, speech, etc."
19,27,فَأَتَتۡ بِهِۦ قَوۡمَهَا تَحۡمِلُهُۥۖ قَالُواْ يَٰمَرۡيَمُ لَقَدۡ جِئۡتِ شَيۡـٔٗا فَرِيّٗا,"Then she came to her people carrying him. They said, “O Mary, you have committed something monstrous!",
19,28,يَٰٓأُخۡتَ هَٰرُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ ٱمۡرَأَ سَوۡءٖ وَمَا كَانَتۡ أُمُّكِ بَغِيّٗا,"O sister of Aaron,[8] your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.”","[8] Aaron was a pious man at the time of Mary, or she was from the descendants of Aaron, Moses’ brother."
19,29,فَأَشَارَتۡ إِلَيۡهِۖ قَالُواْ كَيۡفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِي ٱلۡمَهۡدِ صَبِيّٗا,"Thereupon she pointed to him. They said, “How can we talk to someone who is still a baby in the cradle?”",
19,30,قَالَ إِنِّي عَبۡدُ ٱللَّهِ ءَاتَىٰنِيَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَجَعَلَنِي نَبِيّٗا,"Jesus said, “I am a slave of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.",
19,31,وَجَعَلَنِي مُبَارَكًا أَيۡنَ مَا كُنتُ وَأَوۡصَٰنِي بِٱلصَّلَوٰةِ وَٱلزَّكَوٰةِ مَا دُمۡتُ حَيّٗا,"He has made me blessed wherever I may be, and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I am alive,",
19,32,وَبَرَّۢا بِوَٰلِدَتِي وَلَمۡ يَجۡعَلۡنِي جَبَّارٗا شَقِيّٗا,"and has made me dutiful to my mother, and has not made me an oppressor or disobedient.",
19,33,وَٱلسَّلَٰمُ عَلَيَّ يَوۡمَ وُلِدتُّ وَيَوۡمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوۡمَ أُبۡعَثُ حَيّٗا,"Peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I will die and the day I will be resurrected.”",
19,34,ذَٰلِكَ عِيسَى ٱبۡنُ مَرۡيَمَۖ قَوۡلَ ٱلۡحَقِّ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ يَمۡتَرُونَ,"Such was Jesus, son of Mary – a word of truth about which they are in doubt.",
19,35,مَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٖۖ سُبۡحَٰنَهُۥٓۚ إِذَا قَضَىٰٓ أَمۡرٗا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُۥ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"It is not befitting for Allah to beget a son. Glory be to Him[9]! When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.","[9] i.e., far exalted is He above any such need."
19,36,وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمۡ فَٱعۡبُدُوهُۚ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٞ مُّسۡتَقِيمٞ,"[Jesus said], “Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.”",
19,37,فَٱخۡتَلَفَ ٱلۡأَحۡزَابُ مِنۢ بَيۡنِهِمۡۖ فَوَيۡلٞ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشۡهَدِ يَوۡمٍ عَظِيمٍ,But the factions differed among themselves[10] [about him]. So woe to the disbelievers from the scene of a momentous Day!,"[10] Some believed that Jesus was God or the son of God, whereas those who truly followed him considered him only as Allah's messenger."
19,38,أَسۡمِعۡ بِهِمۡ وَأَبۡصِرۡ يَوۡمَ يَأۡتُونَنَا لَٰكِنِ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ فِي ضَلَٰلٖ مُّبِينٖ,How sharp they will hear and see on the Day they come to Us! But today the wrongdoers are clearly misguided.,
19,39,وَأَنذِرۡهُمۡ يَوۡمَ ٱلۡحَسۡرَةِ إِذۡ قُضِيَ ٱلۡأَمۡرُ وَهُمۡ فِي غَفۡلَةٖ وَهُمۡ لَا يُؤۡمِنُونَ,"Warn them of the Day of Remorse when all matters will be decided, but they are heedless and they do not believe.",

19,41,وَٱذۡكُرۡ فِي ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَۚ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ صِدِّيقٗا نَّبِيًّا,And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. He was indeed a man of truth and a prophet.,
19,42,إِذۡ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ يَٰٓأَبَتِ لِمَ تَعۡبُدُ مَا لَا يَسۡمَعُ وَلَا يُبۡصِرُ وَلَا يُغۡنِي عَنكَ شَيۡـٔٗا,"When he said to his father, “O my dear father, why do you worship something that neither hears nor sees nor benefits you in any way?",
19,43,يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّي قَدۡ جَآءَنِي مِنَ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ مَا لَمۡ يَأۡتِكَ فَٱتَّبِعۡنِيٓ أَهۡدِكَ صِرَٰطٗا سَوِيّٗا,"O my dear father, there has come to me some knowledge that has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to a straight path.",
19,44,يَٰٓأَبَتِ لَا تَعۡبُدِ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنَۖ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنَ كَانَ لِلرَّحۡمَٰنِ عَصِيّٗا,"O my dear father, do not worship Satan. Indeed, Satan is rebellious against the Most Compassionate.",
19,45,يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّيٓ أَخَافُ أَن يَمَسَّكَ عَذَابٞ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ فَتَكُونَ لِلشَّيۡطَٰنِ وَلِيّٗا,"O my dear father, I truly fear that a punishment from the Most Compassionate may afflict you and that you may become a companion of Satan [in Hell].”",
19,46,قَالَ أَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنۡ ءَالِهَتِي يَٰٓإِبۡرَٰهِيمُۖ لَئِن لَّمۡ تَنتَهِ لَأَرۡجُمَنَّكَۖ وَٱهۡجُرۡنِي مَلِيّٗا,"He said, “Are you turning away from my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you. Keep away from me for a long time!”",
19,47,قَالَ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيۡكَۖ سَأَسۡتَغۡفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّيٓۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ بِي حَفِيّٗا,"Abraham said, “Peace be on you[11]. I will seek my Lord’s forgiveness for you. Indeed, He is Most Gracious to me.","[11] i.e., You are secure from me, so I will not harm you in the least."
19,48,وَأَعۡتَزِلُكُمۡ وَمَا تَدۡعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَدۡعُواْ رَبِّي عَسَىٰٓ أَلَّآ أَكُونَ بِدُعَآءِ رَبِّي شَقِيّٗا,"I will distance myself from you and from all that you supplicate besides Allah, and I will supplicate my Lord; perhaps my supplication to my Lord will not go unanswered.”",
19,49,فَلَمَّا ٱعۡتَزَلَهُمۡ وَمَا يَعۡبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَهَبۡنَا لَهُۥٓ إِسۡحَٰقَ وَيَعۡقُوبَۖ وَكُلّٗا جَعَلۡنَا نَبِيّٗا,"When he distanced himself from them and what they worshiped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob and made each one of them a prophet.",

He was indeed a chosen one and was a messenger and a prophet[13].,"[13] A messenger (rasūl) is one who was sent by Allah to reform society with a new law, such as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, etc. A prophet (nabī) is one who is charged by Allah to reform society following the law of the messenger before him, such as Jacob, Isaac, Solomon, etc. Prophets are more numerous than messengers."
19,52,وَنَٰدَيۡنَٰهُ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلۡأَيۡمَنِ وَقَرَّبۡنَٰهُ نَجِيّٗا,We called him from the right side of Mount Tūr [in Sinai] and We brought him near by conversing with him in private.,

19,58,أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيۡهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّـۧنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءَادَمَ وَمِمَّنۡ حَمَلۡنَا مَعَ نُوحٖ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسۡرَٰٓءِيلَ وَمِمَّنۡ هَدَيۡنَا وَٱجۡتَبَيۡنَآۚ إِذَا تُتۡلَىٰ عَلَيۡهِمۡ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ خَرُّواْۤ سُجَّدٗاۤ وَبُكِيّٗا۩,"These are the prophets whom Allah has favored from among the descendants of Adam, and from those whom We carried with Noah [in the Ark], and from the descendants of Abraham and Israel [i.e., Jacob], and from those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the verses of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down in prostration, weeping.",
19,59,۞ فَخَلَفَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِهِمۡ خَلۡفٌ أَضَاعُواْ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِۖ فَسَوۡفَ يَلۡقَوۡنَ غَيًّا,"But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and pursued their desires; so they will meet their doom[16],","[16] i.e., a valley in Hell or the consequence of their evil deeds."

19,63,تِلۡكَ ٱلۡجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِي نُورِثُ مِنۡ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّٗا,Such is the Paradise which We will give as an inheritance to those of Our slaves who feared Allah.,
19,64,وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلَّا بِأَمۡرِ رَبِّكَۖ لَهُۥ مَا بَيۡنَ أَيۡدِينَا وَمَا خَلۡفَنَا وَمَا بَيۡنَ ذَٰلِكَۚ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيّٗا,"[Gabriel said][18], “We do not descend except with the command of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us, all that is behind us, and all that is in between. Your Lord is never forgetful.",[18] In reply to the Prophet’s wish that Gabriel would visit him more frequently.
19,65,رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَمَا بَيۡنَهُمَا فَٱعۡبُدۡهُ وَٱصۡطَبِرۡ لِعِبَٰدَتِهِۦۚ هَلۡ تَعۡلَمُ لَهُۥ سَمِيّٗا,Lord of the heavens and earth and all that is between them. So worship Him and be constant in worshiping Him. Do you know anyone equal to Him?”,

19,68,فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحۡشُرَنَّهُمۡ وَٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ ثُمَّ لَنُحۡضِرَنَّهُمۡ حَوۡلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيّٗا,"By your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils, then We will surely bring them all around Hell on their knees[19].","[19] i.e., out of terror they will be on their knees or dragged unwillingly while on their knees."

19,71,وَإِن مِّنكُمۡ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَاۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتۡمٗا مَّقۡضِيّٗا,There is none among you except that he will pass over it[20]; a decree from your Lord that must be fulfilled.,"[20] Referring to the bridge of As-Sirāt, which is placed over Hell. Everyone will pass on it. The believers will cross it easily, each according to their faith, whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will fall into the Fire from the bridge."
