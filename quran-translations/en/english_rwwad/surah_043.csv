43,4,وَإِنَّهُۥ فِيٓ أُمِّ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَدَيۡنَا لَعَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ,"and it is in the Master Book[2] with us, highly esteemed, full of wisdom.","[2] i.e., the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfūz)."
43,5,أَفَنَضۡرِبُ عَنكُمُ ٱلذِّكۡرَ صَفۡحًا أَن كُنتُمۡ قَوۡمٗا مُّسۡرِفِينَ,Should We then turn the Reminder[3] away from you simply because you are a transgressing people?,"[3] i.e., the Qur’an."
43,6,وَكَمۡ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مِن نَّبِيّٖ فِي ٱلۡأَوَّلِينَ,How many a prophet did We send to the earlier peoples!,
43,7,وَمَا يَأۡتِيهِم مِّن نَّبِيٍّ إِلَّا كَانُواْ بِهِۦ يَسۡتَهۡزِءُونَ,No prophet ever came to them except that they ridiculed him.,

[5] Such as the people of Noah, Lot, Shu’ayb and other nations who were destroyed."
43,9,وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡعَلِيمُ,"If you ask them, “Who created the heavens and earth?”, they will surely say, “The All-Mighty, the All-Knowing created them.”",
43,10,ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأَرۡضَ مَهۡدٗا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمۡ فِيهَا سُبُلٗا لَّعَلَّكُمۡ تَهۡتَدُونَ,"It is He Who spread out the earth for you, and made therein pathways for you, so that you may find your way.",

43,13,لِتَسۡتَوُۥاْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِۦ ثُمَّ تَذۡكُرُواْ نِعۡمَةَ رَبِّكُمۡ إِذَا ٱسۡتَوَيۡتُمۡ عَلَيۡهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱلَّذِي سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُۥ مُقۡرِنِينَ,"so that you may settle yourselves on their backs, then remember the blessings of your Lord when you have settled thereupon and say, “Glory be to Him Who has subjected this for us, for we could not have done it by ourselves[7].","[7] Lit., ""made it a companion"" or ""made it compatible."""
43,14,وَإِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ,It is to our Lord that we will surely return.”,
43,15,وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُۥ مِنۡ عِبَادِهِۦ جُزۡءًاۚ إِنَّ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنَ لَكَفُورٞ مُّبِينٌ,"Yet they ascribe to Him some of His slaves as offspring[8]. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.","[8] By falsely claiming that Allah has a son or daughters, which are the allegations of disbelievers and polytheists."

43,17,وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحۡمَٰنِ مَثَلٗا ظَلَّ وَجۡهُهُۥ مُسۡوَدّٗا وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"When one of them is given tidings of [a baby girl] the like of which he ascribes to the Most Compassionate, his face darkens as he suppresses his rage.",

43,19,وَجَعَلُواْ ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمۡ عِبَٰدُ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ إِنَٰثًاۚ أَشَهِدُواْ خَلۡقَهُمۡۚ سَتُكۡتَبُ شَهَٰدَتُهُمۡ وَيُسۡـَٔلُونَ,"They regard the angels, who are slaves of the Most Compassionate, as female. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be written, and they will be questioned!",
43,20,وَقَالُواْ لَوۡ شَآءَ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنُ مَا عَبَدۡنَٰهُمۗ مَّا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنۡ عِلۡمٍۖ إِنۡ هُمۡ إِلَّا يَخۡرُصُونَ,"They say, “If the Most Compassionate had willed, we would not have worshiped them.” They have no knowledge of that; they do nothing but conjecture.",
43,21,أَمۡ ءَاتَيۡنَٰهُمۡ كِتَٰبٗا مِّن قَبۡلِهِۦ فَهُم بِهِۦ مُسۡتَمۡسِكُونَ,"Or have We given them a Book before this [Qur’an], to which they are holding fast?",
43,22,بَلۡ قَالُوٓاْ إِنَّا وَجَدۡنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٖ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاثَٰرِهِم مُّهۡتَدُونَ,"They rather say, “We found our forefathers on a path, and we are seeking guidance in their footsteps.”",

43,24,۞ قَٰلَ أَوَلَوۡ جِئۡتُكُم بِأَهۡدَىٰ مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمۡ عَلَيۡهِ ءَابَآءَكُمۡۖ قَالُوٓاْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرۡسِلۡتُم بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"[The warner] said, “Even if I bring you a better guidance than what you have found your forefathers upon?” They said, “We totally reject what you [prophets] have been sent with.”",
43,25,فَٱنتَقَمۡنَا مِنۡهُمۡۖ فَٱنظُرۡ كَيۡفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلۡمُكَذِّبِينَ,So We took revenge on them; see what was the end of the deniers!,
43,26,وَإِذۡ قَالَ إِبۡرَٰهِيمُ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوۡمِهِۦٓ إِنَّنِي بَرَآءٞ مِّمَّا تَعۡبُدُونَ,"And [remember] when Abraham said to his father and his people, “I disown all that you worship,",
43,27,إِلَّا ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنِي فَإِنَّهُۥ سَيَهۡدِينِ,except the One Who created me; He will surely guide me.”,
43,28,وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةَۢ بَاقِيَةٗ فِي عَقِبِهِۦ لَعَلَّهُمۡ يَرۡجِعُونَ,"And he made it[9] a lasting word among his descendants, so that they may return [to Allah].","[9] i.e., his testimony of faith that none has the right to be worshiped except Allah."
43,29,بَلۡ مَتَّعۡتُ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ وَءَابَآءَهُمۡ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلۡحَقُّ وَرَسُولٞ مُّبِينٞ,"However, I let these [Makkans] and their forefathers[10] enjoy their lives, until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger[11].","[10] i.e., the descendants of Abraham (ﷺ).  [11] i.e., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)."
43,30,وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلۡحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَٰذَا سِحۡرٞ وَإِنَّا بِهِۦ كَٰفِرُونَ,"But when the truth came to them, they said, “This is magic, and we definitely reject it.”",
43,31,وَقَالُواْ لَوۡلَا نُزِّلَ هَٰذَا ٱلۡقُرۡءَانُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٖ مِّنَ ٱلۡقَرۡيَتَيۡنِ عَظِيمٍ,"And they said, “Why was this Qur’an not sent down to a great man from one of the two towns[12]?”","[12] i.e., Makkah and its neighboring town; Tā’if."
43,32,أَهُمۡ يَقۡسِمُونَ رَحۡمَتَ رَبِّكَۚ نَحۡنُ قَسَمۡنَا بَيۡنَهُم مَّعِيشَتَهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۚ وَرَفَعۡنَا بَعۡضَهُمۡ فَوۡقَ بَعۡضٖ دَرَجَٰتٖ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعۡضُهُم بَعۡضٗا سُخۡرِيّٗاۗ وَرَحۡمَتُ رَبِّكَ خَيۡرٞ مِّمَّا يَجۡمَعُونَ,"Is it they who distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We Who have distributed their livelihood among them in the life of this world, and have raised some of them above others in ranks, so that they may serve one another. But the mercy of your Lord is better than what they accumulate.",
43,33,وَلَوۡلَآ أَن يَكُونَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةٗ وَٰحِدَةٗ لَّجَعَلۡنَا لِمَن يَكۡفُرُ بِٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمۡ سُقُفٗا مِّن فِضَّةٖ وَمَعَارِجَ عَلَيۡهَا يَظۡهَرُونَ,"Were it not that all people might become a single community [of disbelievers][13], We would have given those who disbelieve in the Most Compassionate One houses of sliver roofs and staircases to ascend,",[13] Assuming that Allah’s generosity to them was a sign of His approval.
43,34,وَلِبُيُوتِهِمۡ أَبۡوَٰبٗا وَسُرُرًا عَلَيۡهَا يَتَّكِـُٔونَ,"and their houses having [silver] doors and couches on which they recline,",
43,35,وَزُخۡرُفٗاۚ وَإِن كُلُّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَٰعُ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۚ وَٱلۡأٓخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلۡمُتَّقِينَ,"and [golden] ornaments. But all of these are mere enjoyments of the life of this world, and the Hereafter with your Lord is [only] for those who fear Allah.",
43,36,وَمَن يَعۡشُ عَن ذِكۡرِ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضۡ لَهُۥ شَيۡطَٰنٗا فَهُوَ لَهُۥ قَرِينٞ,"Whoever turns away from the Reminder of the Most Compassionate [i.e., the Qur’an], We assign to him a devil to be his close associate,",
43,37,وَإِنَّهُمۡ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمۡ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَيَحۡسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهۡتَدُونَ,"who will surely avert them from the [right] way, while they think that they are rightly guided.",
43,38,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا جَآءَنَا قَالَ يَٰلَيۡتَ بَيۡنِي وَبَيۡنَكَ بُعۡدَ ٱلۡمَشۡرِقَيۡنِ فَبِئۡسَ ٱلۡقَرِينُ,"Then when he comes to Us, he will say [to his devil associate], “I wish you were as distant from me as the East and West. What a terrible associate [you were]!”",
43,39,وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ إِذ ظَّلَمۡتُمۡ أَنَّكُمۡ فِي ٱلۡعَذَابِ مُشۡتَرِكُونَ,"[They will be told], “As you have done wrong, it will not benefit you Today that you are sharing the punishment[14].”","[14] In the life of this world, it is comforting to many people when they hear that others also went through similar trials. However, this will not be the case on Judgment Day, as everyone will be desperate to save themselves, regardless of what happens to others."
43,40,أَفَأَنتَ تُسۡمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ أَوۡ تَهۡدِي ٱلۡعُمۡيَ وَمَن كَانَ فِي ضَلَٰلٖ مُّبِينٖ,"Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or the one who is clearly misguided?",
43,41,فَإِمَّا نَذۡهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنۡهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ,"Either We take you away [in death], We will surely exact retribution upon them,",
43,42,أَوۡ نُرِيَنَّكَ ٱلَّذِي وَعَدۡنَٰهُمۡ فَإِنَّا عَلَيۡهِم مُّقۡتَدِرُونَ,"or We will show you what We warned them of, for We have full power over them.",
43,43,فَٱسۡتَمۡسِكۡ بِٱلَّذِيٓ أُوحِيَ إِلَيۡكَۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٖ مُّسۡتَقِيمٖ,So hold fast to what is revealed to you. You are indeed on a straight path.,
43,44,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَذِكۡرٞ لَّكَ وَلِقَوۡمِكَۖ وَسَوۡفَ تُسۡـَٔلُونَ,"This [Qur’an] is surely a glory[15] for you and your people, and you will [all] be questioned.","[15] i.e., an honor or a reminder."
43,45,وَسۡـَٔلۡ مَنۡ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مِن قَبۡلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلۡنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ءَالِهَةٗ يُعۡبَدُونَ,Ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We appoint gods to be worshiped besides the Most Compassionate?,
43,46,وَلَقَدۡ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مُوسَىٰ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرۡعَوۡنَ وَمَلَإِيْهِۦ فَقَالَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ,"Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his courtiers, so he said: “I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds.”",
43,47,فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِـَٔايَٰتِنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنۡهَا يَضۡحَكُونَ,"But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them.",
43,48,وَمَا نُرِيهِم مِّنۡ ءَايَةٍ إِلَّا هِيَ أَكۡبَرُ مِنۡ أُخۡتِهَاۖ وَأَخَذۡنَٰهُم بِٱلۡعَذَابِ لَعَلَّهُمۡ يَرۡجِعُونَ,"Every sign We showed them was greater than the one before it[16], and We seized them with punishment[17] so that they may turn in repentance.","[16] i.e., the bright hand and the staff turning into a serpent. See 20:17-22.  [17] i.e., the famine, scarcity of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood. See 7:130-133."
43,49,وَقَالُواْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَ ٱلسَّاحِرُ ٱدۡعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ إِنَّنَا لَمُهۡتَدُونَ,"They said, “O magician, call upon your Lord for us, by virtue of the covenant He has made with you[18]; we will surely accept guidance.”",[18] See 7:134.
43,50,فَلَمَّا كَشَفۡنَا عَنۡهُمُ ٱلۡعَذَابَ إِذَا هُمۡ يَنكُثُونَ,"But as soon We removed the punishment from them, they broke their promise.",
43,51,وَنَادَىٰ فِرۡعَوۡنُ فِي قَوۡمِهِۦ قَالَ يَٰقَوۡمِ أَلَيۡسَ لِي مُلۡكُ مِصۡرَ وَهَٰذِهِ ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِيٓۚ أَفَلَا تُبۡصِرُونَ,"Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, “O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these streams[19] flowing at my feet? Do you not see?","[19] i.e., branches of the Nile River."
43,52,أَمۡ أَنَا۠ خَيۡرٞ مِّنۡ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِي هُوَ مَهِينٞ وَلَا يَكَادُ يُبِينُ,Or am I not better than this contemptible one who can hardly express himself[20]?,"[20] Moses had a speech impediment prior to his mission. However, when he became a prophet he asked Allah to remove his impediment, and his prayer was answered. See 20:25-36."
43,53,فَلَوۡلَآ أُلۡقِيَ عَلَيۡهِ أَسۡوِرَةٞ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوۡ جَآءَ مَعَهُ ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ مُقۡتَرِنِينَ,Then why are there not sent down upon him bracelets of gold or come with him angels to support him?”,
43,54,فَٱسۡتَخَفَّ قَوۡمَهُۥ فَأَطَاعُوهُۚ إِنَّهُمۡ كَانُواْ قَوۡمٗا فَٰسِقِينَ,Thus he made a fool of his people and they obeyed him. They were indeed a wicked people.,
43,55,فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا ٱنتَقَمۡنَا مِنۡهُمۡ فَأَغۡرَقۡنَٰهُمۡ أَجۡمَعِينَ,"When they angered Us, We exacted Our retribution and drowned them all.",
43,56,فَجَعَلۡنَٰهُمۡ سَلَفٗا وَمَثَلٗا لِّلۡأٓخِرِينَ,Thus We made them a precedent and a lesson[21] for the later generations.,"[21] A precedent for those who do not learn any lesson from their example, and a lesson for those who are keen to learn a lesson."
43,57,۞ وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ٱبۡنُ مَرۡيَمَ مَثَلًا إِذَا قَوۡمُكَ مِنۡهُ يَصِدُّونَ,"When the example of the son of Mary was given, your people laughed and jeered[22],","[22] When 21:98 was revealed, warning the pagans that all what they worship besides Allah will be in Hell, a poet who was a staunch enemy of Islam, Abdullah ibn az-Ziba‘ra, along with other pagans jeered and laughed arguing that Jesus will be in Hell as well! The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that the verse was talking exclusively about idols, adding that Jesus himself did not ask to be worshiped. Verse 21:101 was later revealed in support of the Prophet declaring that they are exempted."
43,58,وَقَالُوٓاْ ءَأَٰلِهَتُنَا خَيۡرٌ أَمۡ هُوَۚ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلَّا جَدَلَۢاۚ بَلۡ هُمۡ قَوۡمٌ خَصِمُونَ,"and they said, “Are Our gods better or he[23]?” They only mentioned him to you for the sake of argument. They are indeed a contentious people.","[23] i.e., Jesus."
43,59,إِنۡ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبۡدٌ أَنۡعَمۡنَا عَلَيۡهِ وَجَعَلۡنَٰهُ مَثَلٗا لِّبَنِيٓ إِسۡرَٰٓءِيلَ,He was only a slave whom We[24] favored and made him an example for the Children of Israel.,"[24] i.e., Allah Almighty."
43,60,وَلَوۡ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلۡنَا مِنكُم مَّلَٰٓئِكَةٗ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ يَخۡلُفُونَ,"If We willed, We could [destroy you all and] replace you with angels, succeeding you on earth.",
43,61,وَإِنَّهُۥ لَعِلۡمٞ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلَا تَمۡتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَٱتَّبِعُونِۚ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٞ مُّسۡتَقِيمٞ,"And he [i.e., Jesus] will be a sign of the Hour; so do not have doubt about it and follow me[25]. This is a straight path.","[25] i.e., the Prophet (ﷺ)."
43,62,وَلَا يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُۖ إِنَّهُۥ لَكُمۡ عَدُوّٞ مُّبِينٞ,"Do not let Satan turn you away [from the straight path], for he is your sworn enemy.",
43,63,وَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَىٰ بِٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ قَالَ قَدۡ جِئۡتُكُم بِٱلۡحِكۡمَةِ وَلِأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعۡضَ ٱلَّذِي تَخۡتَلِفُونَ فِيهِۖ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,"When Jesus came with clear signs, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and to clarify to you some of that concerning which you differ; so fear Allah and obey me.",
43,64,إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمۡ فَٱعۡبُدُوهُۚ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطٞ مُّسۡتَقِيمٞ,"Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is a straight path.”",
43,65,فَٱخۡتَلَفَ ٱلۡأَحۡزَابُ مِنۢ بَيۡنِهِمۡۖ فَوَيۡلٞ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنۡ عَذَابِ يَوۡمٍ أَلِيمٍ,But the factions differed among themselves [about Jesus]; so woe to the wrongdoers from the punishment of a painful Day!,
43,66,هَلۡ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا ٱلسَّاعَةَ أَن تَأۡتِيَهُم بَغۡتَةٗ وَهُمۡ لَا يَشۡعُرُونَ,Are they waiting except for the Hour to come upon them by surprise when they least expect it?,
43,67,ٱلۡأَخِلَّآءُ يَوۡمَئِذِۭ بَعۡضُهُمۡ لِبَعۡضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلَّا ٱلۡمُتَّقِينَ,"On that Day, close friends will become enemies to one another, except the righteous,",
