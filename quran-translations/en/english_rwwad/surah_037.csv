[17] The disbelievers of Makkah derided the Prophet (ﷺ) when he warned them of this tree. They wondered how a tree could grow in Hellfire. So Allah revealed this verse.
37,63,إِنَّا جَعَلۡنَٰهَا فِتۡنَةٗ لِّلظَّٰلِمِينَ,We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers.,
37,64,إِنَّهَا شَجَرَةٞ تَخۡرُجُ فِيٓ أَصۡلِ ٱلۡجَحِيمِ,It is a tree that grows in the bottom of the Blazing Fire;,
37,65,طَلۡعُهَا كَأَنَّهُۥ رُءُوسُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينِ,its fruits are like heads of devils.,

37,78,وَتَرَكۡنَا عَلَيۡهِ فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرِينَ,and We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
37,79,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰ نُوحٖ فِي ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ,“Peace be upon Noah among all the nations.”,
37,80,إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجۡزِي ٱلۡمُحۡسِنِينَ,This is how We reward those who do good.,

37,84,إِذۡ جَآءَ رَبَّهُۥ بِقَلۡبٖ سَلِيمٍ,"When he came to his Lord with a sound heart,",
37,85,إِذۡ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوۡمِهِۦ مَاذَا تَعۡبُدُونَ,"and said to his father and his people, “What are you worshiping?",
37,86,أَئِفۡكًا ءَالِهَةٗ دُونَ ٱللَّهِ تُرِيدُونَ,Is it false gods that you seek other than Allah?,
37,87,فَمَا ظَنُّكُم بِرَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ,Then what do you think of the Lord of the worlds?”,
37,88,فَنَظَرَ نَظۡرَةٗ فِي ٱلنُّجُومِ,"He then cast a glance at the stars[20],","[20] His people had faith in astrology, so Abraham pretended to do the same to show them that he was not able to join them at their pagan feast and to remain in their temple of idols, while he was planning to destroy their idols."
37,89,فَقَالَ إِنِّي سَقِيمٞ,"and said, “I am sick[21].”","[21] The Prophet (ﷺ) said: “Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not lie except for three lies: His saying {I am sick} and his saying {Rather, the chief of them did this} and his saying about his wife, “She is my sister.” [Al-Bukhāri, Muslim]. Two of them were for the sake of Allah, and the third one was for the sake of his sister."
37,90,فَتَوَلَّوۡاْ عَنۡهُ مُدۡبِرِينَ,So they went away from him and left.,

37,101,فَبَشَّرۡنَٰهُ بِغُلَٰمٍ حَلِيمٖ,So We gave him glad tidings of a forbearing boy[23].,"[23] i.e., Ishmael"
37,102,فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ ٱلسَّعۡيَ قَالَ يَٰبُنَيَّ إِنِّيٓ أَرَىٰ فِي ٱلۡمَنَامِ أَنِّيٓ أَذۡبَحُكَ فَٱنظُرۡ مَاذَا تَرَىٰۚ قَالَ يَٰٓأَبَتِ ٱفۡعَلۡ مَا تُؤۡمَرُۖ سَتَجِدُنِيٓ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ,"Then when he reached the age where he could work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice you. What do you think?” He said, “O my dear father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, one of the steadfast.”",
37,103,فَلَمَّآ أَسۡلَمَا وَتَلَّهُۥ لِلۡجَبِينِ,"When they both submitted [to Allah’s command] and Abraham laid him on his forehead,",
37,104,وَنَٰدَيۡنَٰهُ أَن يَٰٓإِبۡرَٰهِيمُ,"and We called out to him, “O Abraham,",

37,107,وَفَدَيۡنَٰهُ بِذِبۡحٍ عَظِيمٖ,"And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice[24],",[24] Allah Almighty sent a ram to be sacrificed in place of Ishmael.
37,108,وَتَرَكۡنَا عَلَيۡهِ فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرِينَ,and We left for him [a favorable mention] among later generations:,
37,109,سَلَٰمٌ عَلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ,“Peace be upon Abraham.”,
37,110,كَذَٰلِكَ نَجۡزِي ٱلۡمُحۡسِنِينَ,This is how We reward those who do good.,

This is also supported by 11:71, where Sarah is told that she would give birth to Isaac, who would have a son by the name of Jacob."
37,113,وَبَٰرَكۡنَا عَلَيۡهِ وَعَلَىٰٓ إِسۡحَٰقَۚ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحۡسِنٞ وَظَالِمٞ لِّنَفۡسِهِۦ مُبِينٞ,"We blessed him[26] and Isaac, but among their offspring were some who did good and some who clearly wronged themselves.",[26] Abraham or Ishmael.
