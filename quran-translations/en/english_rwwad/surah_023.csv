So away with the wrongdoing people!","[12] i.e., a piercing cry.  [13] Ghutha’ literally means the froth thrown out by flood waters on the banks."

So We destroyed them, one after the others, and made them mere tales[14]. Away with the people who refuse to believe[15]!","[14] i.e., history or lessons for people.  [15] i.e., those who refuse to believe in the messengers."
23,45,ثُمَّ أَرۡسَلۡنَا مُوسَىٰ وَأَخَاهُ هَٰرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا وَسُلۡطَٰنٖ مُّبِينٍ,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs[16] and compelling proof[17],"[16] Allah sent them both with nine clear signs or miracles: the staff turning into a snake, the bright hand, famine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood.  [17] i.e., compelling proof that they were Allah’s messengers."
23,46,إِلَىٰ فِرۡعَوۡنَ وَمَلَإِيْهِۦ فَٱسۡتَكۡبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوۡمًا عَالِينَ,"to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they showed arrogance and were haughty people.",
23,47,فَقَالُوٓاْ أَنُؤۡمِنُ لِبَشَرَيۡنِ مِثۡلِنَا وَقَوۡمُهُمَا لَنَا عَٰبِدُونَ,"They said, “Should we believe in two men like ourselves when their people are our slaves?”",
23,48,فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ ٱلۡمُهۡلَكِينَ,So they rejected them both and were among those who were destroyed.,

[20] Other Prophets were rejected for being human beings; whereas, people went to two extremes regarding Jesus: some considered him as divine, while some others went to the other extreme by accusing Mary of unchastity, although they were witnesses of the miraculous birth of Jesus and had heard him speak in the cradle."
23,51,يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلرُّسُلُ كُلُواْ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ وَٱعۡمَلُواْ صَٰلِحًاۖ إِنِّي بِمَا تَعۡمَلُونَ عَلِيمٞ,"O messengers[21], eat from the lawful things[22] and act righteously, for I am All-Knowing of what you do.","[21] In this verse, all of the messengers have been addressed together, which indicates that they all belonged to the same community and their message was one. [22] They must be wholesome and earned in lawful ways."
23,52,وَإِنَّ هَٰذِهِۦٓ أُمَّتُكُمۡ أُمَّةٗ وَٰحِدَةٗ وَأَنَا۠ رَبُّكُمۡ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"Indeed, this religion of yours is one religion[23], and I am your Lord, so fear Me.","[23] i.e., the religion of Islam, which is submission to the will of Allah."
23,53,فَتَقَطَّعُوٓاْ أَمۡرَهُم بَيۡنَهُمۡ زُبُرٗاۖ كُلُّ حِزۡبِۭ بِمَا لَدَيۡهِمۡ فَرِحُونَ,"But people split up their religion into factions, each faction rejoicing in what it has[24].","[24] Of beliefs, opinions, and customs."
23,54,فَذَرۡهُمۡ فِي غَمۡرَتِهِمۡ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,So leave them in their heedlessness for a while.,
23,55,أَيَحۡسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُم بِهِۦ مِن مَّالٖ وَبَنِينَ,"Do they think that what We give them wealth and children,",
23,56,نُسَارِعُ لَهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡخَيۡرَٰتِۚ بَل لَّا يَشۡعُرُونَ,"that We hasten to them all that is good? No, but they do not perceive it[25].",[25] They do not perceive that the good things given to them in this world are but a trial for them to increase in sin and disobedience.

23,58,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِـَٔايَٰتِ رَبِّهِمۡ يُؤۡمِنُونَ,"and those who believe in the verses of their Lord,",
23,59,وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِرَبِّهِمۡ لَا يُشۡرِكُونَ,"and those who do not associate partners with their Lord,",
23,60,وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤۡتُونَ مَآ ءَاتَواْ وَّقُلُوبُهُمۡ وَجِلَةٌ أَنَّهُمۡ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمۡ رَٰجِعُونَ,"and those who do whatever [good] they do with their hearts fearful[27], knowing that they will return to their Lord –",[27] That their deeds may not be acceptable.
23,61,أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِي ٱلۡخَيۡرَٰتِ وَهُمۡ لَهَا سَٰبِقُونَ,"it is they who hasten to do good deeds, and they are foremost in them.",
23,62,وَلَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفۡسًا إِلَّا وُسۡعَهَاۚ وَلَدَيۡنَا كِتَٰبٞ يَنطِقُ بِٱلۡحَقِّ وَهُمۡ لَا يُظۡلَمُونَ,"We do not burden a soul more than what it can bear. We have a Record [of their deeds][28] that tells the truth, and none will be wronged[29].",[28] It records every word he utters and every act he does. [29] By wrongfully punishing someone or diminishing the reward of those who did good.
23,63,بَلۡ قُلُوبُهُمۡ فِي غَمۡرَةٖ مِّنۡ هَٰذَا وَلَهُمۡ أَعۡمَٰلٞ مِّن دُونِ ذَٰلِكَ هُمۡ لَهَا عَٰمِلُونَ,"But their hearts are oblivious to this[30], and they have other [evil] deeds that they are doing.","[30] They are heedless of the fact that everything they say or do is recorded in a Record, or that they are heedless of the Qur’an."
23,64,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَخَذۡنَا مُتۡرَفِيهِم بِٱلۡعَذَابِ إِذَا هُمۡ يَجۡـَٔرُونَ,"But as soon as We seize their affluent ones with punishment[31], they start crying for help.",[31] On the Day of Judgment.
23,65,لَا تَجۡـَٔرُواْ ٱلۡيَوۡمَۖ إِنَّكُم مِّنَّا لَا تُنصَرُونَ,"“Do not cry for help today, for you will receive no help from Us.",
23,66,قَدۡ كَانَتۡ ءَايَٰتِي تُتۡلَىٰ عَلَيۡكُمۡ فَكُنتُمۡ عَلَىٰٓ أَعۡقَٰبِكُمۡ تَنكِصُونَ,"My verses were recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels,",
23,67,مُسۡتَكۡبِرِينَ بِهِۦ سَٰمِرٗا تَهۡجُرُونَ,"feeling proud of this [Sacred House], spending night in evil talks [about the Qur’an].”",
23,68,أَفَلَمۡ يَدَّبَّرُواْ ٱلۡقَوۡلَ أَمۡ جَآءَهُم مَّا لَمۡ يَأۡتِ ءَابَآءَهُمُ ٱلۡأَوَّلِينَ,"Have they not pondered the Words [of Allah], or has there come to them what did not come to their forefathers?",
23,69,أَمۡ لَمۡ يَعۡرِفُواْ رَسُولَهُمۡ فَهُمۡ لَهُۥ مُنكِرُونَ,"Or is it that they do not recognize their Messenger, so they deny him?",
23,70,أَمۡ يَقُولُونَ بِهِۦ جِنَّةُۢۚ بَلۡ جَآءَهُم بِٱلۡحَقِّ وَأَكۡثَرُهُمۡ لِلۡحَقِّ كَٰرِهُونَ,"Or do they say, “There is madness in him?” Rather, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are averse to the truth.",
23,71,وَلَوِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلۡحَقُّ أَهۡوَآءَهُمۡ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلۡأَرۡضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّۚ بَلۡ أَتَيۡنَٰهُم بِذِكۡرِهِمۡ فَهُمۡ عَن ذِكۡرِهِم مُّعۡرِضُونَ,"Were the Truth to follow their desires, the heavens and earth, and all those who are therein would have been ruined. In fact, We have given them their Reminder, but they are averse to their Reminder.",
23,72,أَمۡ تَسۡـَٔلُهُمۡ خَرۡجٗا فَخَرَاجُ رَبِّكَ خَيۡرٞۖ وَهُوَ خَيۡرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ,"Or do you ask them for some reward[32]? But the reward of your Lord is best[33], and He is the Best of Providers.","[32] Which did not actually happen.  [33] This was another proof of the Prophet’s prophethood, for he was conveying the message without demanding any recompense for it; rather, he staked his peaceful life and relationships with his people for accomplishing his mission."
23,73,وَإِنَّكَ لَتَدۡعُوهُمۡ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٖ مُّسۡتَقِيمٖ,"Indeed, you are calling them to a straight path,",
23,74,وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ عَنِ ٱلصِّرَٰطِ لَنَٰكِبُونَ,but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from that path.,
23,75,۞ وَلَوۡ رَحِمۡنَٰهُمۡ وَكَشَفۡنَا مَا بِهِم مِّن ضُرّٖ لَّلَجُّواْ فِي طُغۡيَٰنِهِمۡ يَعۡمَهُونَ,"Even if We were to show them mercy and relieve their adversity[34], they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.",[34] It refers to the famine which occurred in Makkah some time after the advent of prophethood.
23,76,وَلَقَدۡ أَخَذۡنَٰهُم بِٱلۡعَذَابِ فَمَا ٱسۡتَكَانُواْ لِرَبِّهِمۡ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,"We have already seized them with punishment, but they did not humble themselves to their Lord, nor did they supplicate in humility,",
23,77,حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَتَحۡنَا عَلَيۡهِم بَابٗا ذَا عَذَابٖ شَدِيدٍ إِذَا هُمۡ فِيهِ مُبۡلِسُونَ,"until when We open for them a gateway of severe punishment, they will be plunged into utter despair.",
23,78,وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيٓ أَنشَأَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمۡعَ وَٱلۡأَبۡصَٰرَ وَٱلۡأَفۡـِٔدَةَۚ قَلِيلٗا مَّا تَشۡكُرُونَ,"It is He Who gave you hearing, sight and hearts. How little you give thanks[35]!","[35] The disbelievers, instead of showing gratefulness for the blessings of eyes, ears, mind, and heart; show ingratitude to their Creator."
