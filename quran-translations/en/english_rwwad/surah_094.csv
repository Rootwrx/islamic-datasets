94,1,أَلَمۡ نَشۡرَحۡ لَكَ صَدۡرَكَ,"Have We not reassured your heart for you [O Prophet][1],","[1] i.e., enlighten and gladden your heart for receiving the revelation."
94,2,وَوَضَعۡنَا عَنكَ وِزۡرَكَ,and relieved you of your burden[2],"[2] forgave your previous or future errors, or relieved you of the anxiety you experienced at the beginning of your mission."
94,3,ٱلَّذِيٓ أَنقَضَ ظَهۡرَكَ,"that weighed down your back,",
94,4,وَرَفَعۡنَا لَكَ ذِكۡرَكَ,and raised high your fame for you[3]?,"[3] Allah raised the Prophet's name in numerous ways, such as his name is mentioned twice in the call to prayer five times a day, as well the second call to prayer; at the end of each of the five daily prayers; believers invoke Allah’s blessings upon him and his family; and upon reverting to Islam, his name is mentioned, etc."
94,5,فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلۡعُسۡرِ يُسۡرًا,"For indeed, with hardship comes ease[4],","[4] In Arabic grammar, if a definite noun is repeated, it is referring to the same thing. However, if an indefinite noun is repeated, it is referring to two different things. So here in this and the coming verse they refer to one hardship (a definite noun) and two eases (an indefinite noun), which manifests Allah's favors upon His servants even in times of hardships."
