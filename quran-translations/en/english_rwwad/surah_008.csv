8,47,وَلَا تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِم بَطَرٗا وَرِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِۚ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعۡمَلُونَ مُحِيطٞ,"Do not be like those[28] who came out of their homes insolently, showing off to people, and preventing others from Allah’s way, for Allah is All-Encompassing of what they do.",[28] The Quraysh army.
8,48,وَإِذۡ زَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُ أَعۡمَٰلَهُمۡ وَقَالَ لَا غَالِبَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٞ لَّكُمۡۖ فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَتِ ٱلۡفِئَتَانِ نَكَصَ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيۡهِ وَقَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيٓءٞ مِّنكُمۡ إِنِّيٓ أَرَىٰ مَا لَا تَرَوۡنَ إِنِّيٓ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَۚ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِ,"And [remember] when Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today, and I am your protector.” But when the two armies faced each other, he turned on his heels and said, “I have nothing to do with you, for I see what you do not see. I surely fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.”",
8,49,إِذۡ يَقُولُ ٱلۡمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ غَرَّ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ دِينُهُمۡۗ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلۡ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٞ,"And [remember] when the hypocrites and those who have sickness in their hearts said, “These [believers] are deluded by their religion.” But whoever puts his trust in Allah[29], Allah is indeed All-Mighty, All-Wise.",[29] Victory is not achieved by mere worldly measures; it only comes from Allah for those who really put their trust in Him.
8,50,وَلَوۡ تَرَىٰٓ إِذۡ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ يَضۡرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمۡ وَأَدۡبَٰرَهُمۡ وَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلۡحَرِيقِ,"If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers, beating their faces and their backs, “Taste the punishment of the scorching fire!",

They disbelieved in the signs of Allah, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful and Severe in Punishment.","[30] The people of ‘Ād, Thamūd and others met the same fate."

They rejected the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them[31] for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh; they were all wrongdoers.",[31] Repetition of the example of the earlier nations is to emphasize the inevitable fate of those who disbelieve or disobey Allah.

8,58,وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوۡمٍ خِيَانَةٗ فَٱنۢبِذۡ إِلَيۡهِمۡ عَلَىٰ سَوَآءٍۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلۡخَآئِنِينَ,"If you fear betrayal from any people, throw their treaty back at them openly[34], for Allah does not like the treacherous.","[34] i.e., announce to them its dissolution so that you both be on the same footing."
8,59,وَلَا يَحۡسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَبَقُوٓاْۚ إِنَّهُمۡ لَا يُعۡجِزُونَ,The disbelievers should not think that they are unreachable; they cannot escape.,

[36] To make them think twice before invading or fighting them.  [37] i.e., lurking enemies.  [38] Funds are necessary for preparing the force."
8,61,۞ وَإِن جَنَحُواْ لِلسَّلۡمِ فَٱجۡنَحۡ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلۡ عَلَى ٱللَّهِۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلۡعَلِيمُ,"If they incline to peace, then incline to it, and put your trust in Allah, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",

8,63,وَأَلَّفَ بَيۡنَ قُلُوبِهِمۡۚ لَوۡ أَنفَقۡتَ مَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ جَمِيعٗا مَّآ أَلَّفۡتَ بَيۡنَ قُلُوبِهِمۡ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيۡنَهُمۡۚ إِنَّهُۥ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٞ,"He brought their hearts together[39], even if you had spent all that is on earth, you could not have brought their hearts together, but Allah has brought them together, for He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","[39] The joining of the hearts was indeed a great favour, as the extent of enmity among them in the pre-Islamic era was rampant."

8,67,مَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُۥٓ أَسۡرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يُثۡخِنَ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۚ تُرِيدُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ٱلۡأٓخِرَةَۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٞ,"It is not befitting for a prophet to take captives[41] until he thoroughly subdues [the enemy] in the land. You desire the gains of this world[42], but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter.

[42] i.e., material benefits, such as the ransom paid by prisoners."
8,68,لَّوۡلَا كِتَٰبٞ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمۡ فِيمَآ أَخَذۡتُمۡ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٞ,"Were it not for a prior decree[43] from Allah, you would have surely been afflicted with a great punishment for what you have taken [of ransom].","[43] This ‘decree’: 1) that He would make spoils and ransom lawful, 2) that He would not punish for a matter not explained previously, 3) and that He would not punish the Companions who attended Badr."
8,69,فَكُلُواْ مِمَّا غَنِمۡتُمۡ حَلَٰلٗا طَيِّبٗاۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٞ,"So consume what you have gained in war, for it is lawful[44] and good, but fear Allah. Allah is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","[44] When Allah saw the destitution and helplessness of the Muslims, He made gains of war lawful for them."
