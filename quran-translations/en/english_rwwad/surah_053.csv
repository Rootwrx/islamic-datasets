53,3,وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ ٱلۡهَوَىٰٓ,Nor does he speak out of his own desire.,
53,4,إِنۡ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحۡيٞ يُوحَىٰ,It is but a revelation sent down [to him].,

53,6,ذُو مِرَّةٖ فَٱسۡتَوَىٰ,"and of great perfection[2], who manifested himself [in his true form][3]","[2] i.e., the strength of body and mind.  [3] Archangel Gabriel appeared to the Prophet (ﷺ) only twice in his angelic form: once at the outset of the Prophet’s mission (as he manifested himself, filling the horizon, so the Prophet (ﷺ) lost his consciousness), and another time during the Prophet’s ascension to the seventh heaven where he directly received from Allah the order to pray five times a day. See 17:1."
53,7,وَهُوَ بِٱلۡأُفُقِ ٱلۡأَعۡلَىٰ,when he was on the higher horizon[4].,"[4] i.e., above the eastern horizon in the sky where the sun rises."

53,11,مَا كَذَبَ ٱلۡفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَىٰٓ,The [Prophet’s] heart[6] did not deny what he saw.,"[6] i.e., his mind or perception."
53,12,أَفَتُمَٰرُونَهُۥ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَىٰ,Do you dispute with him concerning what he saw?,

53,21,أَلَكُمُ ٱلذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ ٱلۡأُنثَىٰ,Do you choose for yourselves males and for Him females?,

Indeed, your Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you best, as He created you from the earth[13] and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers[14]. So do not claim purity for yourselves, for He knows best who is truly righteous.","[13] i.e., created your father, Adam.  [14] See footnote 31:34."
